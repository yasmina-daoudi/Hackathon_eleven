aeroflot,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,February 2021,3,4,2,,,1,"  Absolutely horrible business practices! The trip started with an understandable weather delay which developed into a 36 he mechanical delay because the plane was not properly maintained during the storm. Allegiant refused to recognize it as mechanical issue instead of weather despite the fact that other airlines were flying in and out in those conditions. This delay cost me an overnight stay waiting for the flight to either be fixed or a rescue plane sent. Additional cost for food as there was only one venue available and we were told to stay near the gate. I also lost money on my destination lodging which was no longer refundable or able to cancel because delays took so long. when I contacted Allegiant customer service about the issue they absolutely refused to acknowledge any wrongdoing and stated that they were not required by law to provide any kind of compensation. I recognize that there is no legal obligation but there is an obligation for the business to act in good faith towards its customers. All told, I paid $270 for the flight and an additional $250 in food and lodging expense as a result of the delay. The company refuses to do right by the situation. This is not my first go round with delays and cancellations with this company but it will be my last. Fly with caution!",no

This delay cost me an overnight stay waiting for the flight to either be fixed or a rescue plane sent. Additional cost for food as there was only one venue available and we were told to stay near the gate. I also lost money on my destination lodging which was no longer refundable or able to cancel because delays took so long. when I contacted Allegiant customer service about the issue they absolutely refused to acknowledge any wrongdoing and stated that they were not required by law to provide any kind of compensation. I recognize that there is no legal obligation but there is an obligation for the business to act in good faith towards its customers. All told, I paid $270 for the flight and an additional $250 in food and lodging expense as a result of the delay. The company refuses to do right by the situation. This is not my first go round with delays and cancellations with this company but it will be my last. Fly with caution!",no
