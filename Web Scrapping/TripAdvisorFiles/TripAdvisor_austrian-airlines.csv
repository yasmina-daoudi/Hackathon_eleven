But now sense she has recovered we have been trying to get the ticket reissued and have been trying for 2 weeks now.

The process of suspending it was very easy because I just had to send them the PCR test showing a positive result. But now sense she has recovered we have been trying to get the ticket reissued and have been trying for 2 weeks now. They have been extremely slow and been lying constantly about returning phone calls and making false promises for the new rebooking. As of now I have sent the positive PCR results in 3 times to them and am starting to go around the same loop again. I will update this as more news come.,no

The process of suspending it was very easy because I just had to send them the PCR test showing a positive result. But now sense she has recovered we have been trying to get the ticket reissued and have been trying for 2 weeks now. They have been extremely slow and been lying constantly about returning phone calls and making false promises for the new rebooking. As of now I have sent the positive PCR results in 3 times to them and am starting to go around the same loop again. I will update this as more news come.,no
