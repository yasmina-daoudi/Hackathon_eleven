0|"Very average in flight service, no difference from competition. On line service is abysmal: my flight was canceled due to COVID19 and 6 weeks after I requested a refund I am still waiting. The excuses I was served on the phone were: ""covid/delays/lots of work/etc..."". I had to do the same with British Airways for another ticket: I got my refund in 3 days! Guess where I'll go for my next ticket?!
Also when I asked for my refund on the French website (airfrance.fr) I received an email asking me to make this request from the US website where apparently I had bought my ticket: well.... BA again: I had bought my ticket in the US, the person I got on the phone was in the UK and I still got a refund IN 3 DAYS! Despite BA's 12,000 layoffs! Air France, are you paying attention??"|air-france
1|"I have not flown Air France for years and saw the negative Yelp reviews of their Service.

I found business class to be superb ( and the price very reasonable for what you get).

Their lounges range from good to excellent.

The planes are not brand spanking new ( I believe they were Boeing 777). On the way over they had only biz and economy and on the way back they had first class which looked really nice. The seating for business class is excellent  1-2-1. We had the windows and it is very private and peaceful.

The business class seats are very comfortable and lie flat. Plenty of cushion and excellent width to sleep.

Entertainment is okay not fantastic but they have enough movies to entertain you ( not a lot of new releases but some).

Food was excellent. Great selection of entrees, wines, and constant nibbles. Nice breads and cheeses ( what do you expect from France?)

Everyone of the stewards was pleasant and helpful.

Luggage got to where it needed to be.

I would definitely fly them again"|air-france
2|Ghetto. Absolutely trash. Do not book with air france it's a waste of time. All air france employees are trained to cause problems and problems only. Disgusting will never fly with this airline ever again. You better flying with Spirit Airlines.....|air-france
3|"The review is for incompetence of call center booking agents at Air France.
I was trying to buy a ticket for me and and extra seat for my oversized musical instrument (cello). I called probably five or six times and waited for 24 hours for the request t one approved. Every time my request was denied because the codeshare air company and Air France were not able to agree on the terms of how to PROPERLY submit the cabin baggage request through the system... WTH?!
Every time I would call again to check on the status of the request, an incompetent agent would erase the reservation and made a new one creating more confusion.
C'mon Air France, it cannot be that hard to book an extra seat for the cello!
I'm flying with the different company!"|air-france
4|"It's been a while since I flew Air France long-haul last time, but I enjoyed the overall experience.  The check-in counter lady was polite and very friendly, and went though all the details including TSA pre-check eligibility, AF lounge, connection at CDG, etc.

The lounge @ SFO was okay, and nothing to write about...

The aircraft was B777-300 which had the updated Business Class seats with 1-2-1 setting (solo seats at window, 2 seats in the middle).  Selecting the small cabin with only 4 rows just behind the La Premiere section was perfect - more private than the second cabin.

The service was great - probably being served by 3-4 professional and friendly crew.  All was done in polished style.  Since they didn't have a printed menu (I was told they failed to load before leaving CDG), the crew explained four different options in detail along with his recommendations.  Glad to go with beef tenderloin (not over-cooked which is uncommon as airline food)...it was served with Edmond Fallot mustard selection which made me happy!

The breakfast was also served as individual pace - based on the timing when you wake up.  It was not like they wake you up when they decide to serve breakfast at most US carriers even on Business Class so that crew can cleanup way before landing and they can relax... ;)"|air-france
5|"We upgraded two seats to business class and while boarding, we found a dirty fork on the seat. We almost sat on it. Plus, the seat and tray were dirty. This is truly unacceptable.

We were only offered an apology until I fought the issue for weeks. Then we were offered only one hundred. That's not fair at all."|air-france
6|Second time this year flying with Air France and have been pleased both times. Flight attendants' demeanor is respectful and pleasant--they act as though it's their pleasure to serve you. Food is always good; alcoholic drinks are complementary (I always go with bubbly bc flying to Paris is always cause for celebration). Lastly-they are always on time, or early.|air-france
7|I have been trying to get a refund for over 3 months now.  Process is terrible. I received an email on 10 June saying they would process my refund. I put in the request on 6 May.  All other airlines and hotels have refunded me over a month ago.  Ridiculous and I will not bother with this airline in future.|air-france
8|"I am convinced that Air France ""customer care"" agents go out of their way to show customers that Air France does not believe in ""customer service"" and if they can screw you out of money, they will do it with pleasure.  In October 2019,  I flew to Paris from Marseille and my new baby stroller did not make it with the rest of my luggage.  I made a report and AF promised to deliver the stroller the next day.  2 days and many phone calls later, the AF agent told me that I could buy a new baby stroller for up to 100 euros since we had no way to tour Paris without a stroller for my 18 month old. I bought the cheapest stroller for 40 euros.  2 weeks later, back in Marseille, I received a dirty, torn up stroller.  When I filed a claim, the agent rejected it stating: ""We normally advise our customers to rent a stroller while it is delayed.""????  July 2020 I decided to give AF another chance.  We flew from Paris to Chicago on an almost empty flight.  We checked 6 pieces of luggage, 2 1/2 hours before departure...and still AF managed to lose my luggage!  I immediately filed a report and spoke to 3 agents on the phone regarding reimbursement.  They all said I was eligible for reimbursement, I simply needed to submit my receipts online.  Not one mentioned a deadline.  Despite many difficulties during our trip, including a sick child, I submitted my reimbursement claim 26 days after I received my luggage. I  immediately received a response from the ""customer care"" agent that the deadline was 21 days, so Air France would not give me any compensation for having to spend the the first 4 days of my vacation without my luggage. She didn't even pretend to care or try to fix my problem because she didn't care."|air-france
9|"I flew air france business class to CDG from SFO non stop using an airbus. Everything went smooth with the exception of the boarding area in SFO where passengers started to pack near the door entrance to the ramp when it was time to board and it almost seemed chaotic with no clear indication where you were supposed to go based on your seating/class. There was alot of ""excuse me,coming through"" to get through the crowded area. The business cabin itself was decent with almost pod like set up for your seat. I liked the lie flat seats and lovely food served during the flight. Although it was a bumpy ride with lightning seen over the horizon through my window, I was still able to catch some sleep before landing. The lavatory is the typical ones you would see in a plane, nothing fancy or bigger. I would definitely fly air france again."|air-france
10|"I was on Air France website and was in the process of booking fares for my wife and I to Paris...  I intentionally started with the airfare, because we have the flexibility to travel at anytime.  So I found a fare from SFO to CDG on the 6th of September, for $667.00 per person for premium economy.  Located a return fare on September 19th, for $587.00 per person for premium economy.  Awesome!!!  
I was able to select my seats, for both flights 25G and 25H.  Good!!!
When I went to pay for the fares, their website came back with a &^*%$@ing Error!  I had to start over.  The only problem is they jacked up the departing fare to $1,557!!!   WTF!  Air France is a messed up company!  I really enjoyed them when we flew to Tahiti, but these kind of tactics are BS!  Don't Fly AIR FRANCE!

Update:  Called Air France this morning to speak to customer care.  Instead I ended up talking with a supervising agent.  I explained what happened yesterday and she was apologetic.  She asked if I still had the travel day flexibility I mentioned above.  With that, she was able to find me the prices I was looking for on slightly different days.  I tried doing that yesterday, but was not as successful as her.  She really worked the software over to find me seats at the prices I had found before.  Thank goodness for all of you who still care about customer service.

11|"Flew business from SF to Paris. It was a small 777.

Service was very good...I was flattered that they initially spoke to me in French but sorry I don't remember any of the French I learned in middle school. The seat was older but comfy. It is not Emirates which is my favorite."|air-france
12|"Beware of flying 777-300's from Paris to SFO, these are older planes....bathrooms are smellier and facilities not as nice.

Also the seat back pockets let everything slip out (not enclosed), don't put your cell phone or anything important in there!

Food here does have a certain level of class that's ahead of most airlines."|air-france
13|"NEVER EVER FLY WITH THIS TERRIBLE AIRLINE!! The 3 times I have used them, my baggage was lost TWICE and the second time I didn't get my bags for THREE DAYS!!  They promised to call and email me and did absolutely nothing but get pissed off at me for being upset. Well try being in a foreign country and all your stuff missing except the clothes you have on for 3 days!  They are absolutely dumb and don't give a hoot about your concerns!

Never fly AIR FRANCE!!"|air-france
14|Flight was ok. Not much to complain about but the food was pretty bad for airplane food.|air-france
15|The worst airlines ever. Systems are always down and they calculate fare change manually. I would really recommend Turkish airlines instead.|air-france
16|"Alan and I flew Air France Business Class yesterday from SFO to CDG in Paris.  Our experience was excellent from start to finish.  The woman who checked us in was very helpful, offering to call wheelchairs because the walk to security was long and the lines had been extremely long.  She did, but after waiting 15 or 20 minutes for the wheelchairs we decided to chance the walk.  As it happened, the walk wasn't that long, however, the lines were.  Alan did some scouting and found a very helpful man who directed us to TSA Pre Check, past the long lines.  Once in the Pre Check line we were erroneously directed to remove the laptop from Alan's carry-on, but a wonderful woman, Rosario T, took me under her wing and guided me through.  She deserves a separate review.  Just past security is the Air France/KLM Lounge, where we were welcomed.  The lounge is large, larger than we knew, w/ sandwiches, fruit and other food.  There's also an assortment of wines.  The woman at the front desk said the walk to the gate was a long one and ordered us two wheel chairs.  We were picked up a while before the plane started boarding and it was really helpful, as the walk would have been long and complicated w/ changes of levels, etc.

We boarded through one of three doors.  One of the flight attendants took my bag and helped me put it in the overhead bin.  The very best part was how mindful they were of Alan's need for a low sodium diet.  The meals were tasty and well prepared and he was very pleased.  My meals were quite good as well and my expectations for airline food are pretty low.  I had wanted scallops, but they were out, so I had beef and it was tender and cooked perfectly medium rare.  There were several courses and each one was good.  My only complaint would be that the champagne and the white wine weren't cold enough and the water for the tea wasn't hot enough.  Small complaints.  I skipped the morning meal because I'm never hungry in the morning.  We had wheelchairs ordered for CDG and so we had to wait aboard for them after we landed.  When they arrived the same flight attendant who helped me in helped me out.  There is a large flight crew and we were well attended.  Interestingly, none of the crew wore name tags, just patches reading ""Safety and Security"".  We've not seen that before."|air-france
17|"Air France, I want you to know that you have been absolutely fantastic. I will always seek out your airline and recommend it to everyone I know. I had to re-schedule my flight due to unexpected illness in my family and your representative here in the U.S Kristen/with Delta, was kind and understanding. So helpful and just human. She made this the best experience, better than anything I could imagine with any company. The help you have provided will allow me to take care of my family and turn an incredibly stressful day into worry free travel. Thank you Kristen and thank you Delta and most importantly, thank you AIR FRANCE. Merci beaucoup!

I am sorry I did  it get Kristen's last name, but if you can identify her, please tell her she has made a difference in two continents and all of our family thanks her from the bottom of our hearts."|air-france
18|Air France delayed us by a day for our flight, but then offered nothing for doing so. We were given vouchers for a bottom tier hotel, and had to spend a good 8 or so hours dealing with incompetent employees who spoke incomprehensible English. Book at your own risk|air-france
19|"Delayed over an hour, staff speaks incomprehensible English, staff consistantly gave incorrect or false information about why people had to move seats.

Often, the pilot gave directions or information in French with no English accompaniment.

I would highly encourage all fliers to avoid Air France in the future"|air-france
20|"After choosing our vacation flights, times comes to check in on line, where the misleading started. Offered for upgrades to business and we selected SFO to CDG 11 hours segment, and was successful transaction, however when we get to save boarding pass it show the upgrades was for different segment of our trip 5 hrs.

90 minutes on the phone to get to someone and in the end they fake us and let us to believe the problem was resolved and they upgraded the correct segment. At the airport there was nothing in the system and no one can help ""nothing we can do"" they said, we lost such $$$ for upgrades and got faked by customer service so we can put good survey answers on the feed back call.

My advise, never use their fake upgrades till you absolutely sure, even though you not protected."|air-france
21|"Very bad counter staff,  booked flight from sfo 7/1/12 with prepaid extra luggage for $60, however when we got to the counter  
with one more bag they insist on charging $200 per luggage, I had to get he manager to read the company charge codes to believe me. The lady didn't apologize either"|air-france
22|"I am beyond disappointed and mad with my last experience with Air France.
It was an unacceptable experience that I was victim of and I am surprised to witness the lack of care or follow up on my case.

My only desire was to book a ticket in premium economy for both my parents, as a surprise to come visit me in Miami (from Paris).
I booked online on air france web site. I decided to chose premium economy category class.
The return flight had a stop via Atlanta.
As my parents always travel with their small dog, this is the first thing we did after I booked the flight: reserve the dog.
The AF agent assured she will be taking care of reserving the dog on both legs and will follow with a confirmation. Also asked for payment for this trip, which was done.

3 WEEKS later ! we hear that the dog is NOT ALLOWED in premium economy class (only) on the return flight who is operated by Delta airlines.

I was left with no other options than paying $1,200 MORE and have the flight changed to coach category !!!
3 weeks past the date I booked increased the tickets of all flights and this was the only option ! and now, my parents have to travel coach on a ticket that ended up costing me a fortune.

As a executive platinum member with American Airlines I can say I travel quite a bit and this leaves a bad taste to me and my parents.
Embarrassing service for the company ! I dare AF to send me their automatic feedback on my experience link this time around!"|air-france
23|"This is the worst airline when it comes out to luggage handling.

On my 3 last connecting flights they dumped my luggage in Paris since they constantly have a baggage overflow.

Even though they promised me my bag the day after they did not put it on a flight until one week later.

I called them every day and they could not even answer where my bag was.

You even start wondering if they specifically target travelers with non sounding French names since it seemed to be only me and Americans that did not get their ""lost""

Never going to fly connecting flights with them again."|air-france
24|WOW does this airline suck. They lost our luggage and then were major jerks about it. Lowkey this airline is worse than even United. It's kind of nice that they give you blankets, sleeping masks, and headphones free in your flight. They also give you complimentary alcohol, probably because they think that will prevent people from reviewing them like this. I guess a perk is that supposedly they have cheaper flights to France.|air-france
25|"This is the worst airline in the world!
Due to weather delays I got to the checkin counter 5 minutes late --
still 55 minutes from departure time (that was going to be late anyway)

They refuses to help at all, let alone get me on my flight.
The supervisor at SFO seemed almost happy that I just lost over $4000
He said ""There is nobody here to help you. I suggest you call the 800 number"".  He was standing in front of a terminal at the time.

I will never use this airline again.
They hate their customers and it shows."|air-france
26|They will lose your baggage. They will mess up your special meals. They will then be arrogant and unhelpful. Do not use this airline.|air-france
27|"Air France does not even deserve 1 star! I flew from Paris to LA and had the worst experience with them. They literally ruin your vacation! First of first they lost my double stroller and no one takes responsibility for it. I pre ordered kids meal for my kids ( breakfast and dinner) and they only provided dinner, when it was breakfast time they said they only provide kids meal once! Are u kidding! At lease let me know in advance so I come on board prepared! So during the whole 11 hours flight my kids had only one small meal!
Also in CDG airport we had a miserable time! Had to wait outside the building in the heat to get on shuttle and they drove us to the airplane! Like seriously are we in 19th century!
Never fly with them again"|air-france
28|"After flying KLM from SFO to DEL, I had the same high expectations from DEL to SFO.
We got called in the lounge that the flight was boarding so I headed to the gate. The business class folks had a separate entrance/gate. When I sat down, the first thing I noticed was the 2-3-2 layout. I am so happy that I didn't have the middle seat, just seemed annoying. Anyhow, the attendant helped me put my bags again (nice of him). We got our little bags and shoes and were on our merry way.
The food was ok, nothing amazing. No chocolates like KLM after your meal. They did have snacks setup in the galley, drinks, snacks etc.
However, the biggest things I noticed was the lack of service as compared to KLM. You were not served as a multi-course meal as on KLM, but given all courses at once. Also, they didn't have as many offerings. I also noticed that though they listed snacks they had on board, they were not available. The attendants were nice and friendly overall, but the service was again lacking on both Air France flights.
The flight from DEL to CDG was the 2-3-3 seating, but I did notice that the bathroom was a tad bigger with Clarins products. The flight from CDG to SFO was the 1-2-1 private suits. Both sets of beds were lie flat.
The most annoying thing, was they didn't have extra water bottles. I drank my water from CDG to SFO and tossed the bottle. When I asked for an additional bottle to carry during customs I was told there are no more. Seriously? No more water bottles? Absolutely ridiculous."|air-france
29|"This is absolutely a horrible experience for our family flying from LAX TO CDG, PARIS, FRANCE and from CDG, PARIS, FRANCE TO LAX. As a family we purchased our tickets with FLIGHT INSURANCE AND PREPAID FOR OUR SEATS ROUNDUP. I'm a heart patient so I requested bulkhead accommodations for leg room purposes and the ability to go to the closest restroom or toilet.

FROM LAX TO CDG, PARIS, FRANCE my rating would be a ONE STAR. At the Air France counter since we're English speaking and the lady who helped us spoke very good English, she accommodated us on the bulkhead seats but obviously I had to stress the fact that we prepaid for our seats and kindly asked her for a bulkhead seating (family of three for leisure travel). She went out of her way for a supervisor to accommodate me. I was happy and thankful. Their product and service meaning their food, beverage and how they treat you going to Paris was a one star experience because instead of serving us our snacks and beverages, the flight attendant decided for us to get out of our seats and get it ourselves. WHAT?!

The flight back from CDG, PARIS, FRANCE was horrible. They could've handled our cancelled flight better but the way they handled it was awful. They had us lined up standing for a good hour only to find out their computer wouldn't boot up. Sit for another hour then line up. After three hours they had us all board the plane then after an hour all of us had to get off the plane because LAX had computer problems and LAX wouldn't be able to receive us. Flight was cancelled after 9 hours. They had so many changes that even though they offered us a hotel we could no longer trust their process. Flight was for the next day at 10:20 a.m, we did NOT want to miss the flight. I pleaded for bulkhead seats but they couldn't accommodate us, I needed my family to always be with me since I'm a high-risk heart patient. One carry on was an inch short of passing the test, the charge was 50 EUROS about $57! I pleaded with them to let this carry on luggage go but their concerned was to their own service not to our needs.

DO NOT PREPAY FOR SEATS! Waste of money!!! In case of a cancelled flight your PREPAID SEATS have no bearing as to where you'll be seated!!!

DO YOU NOT BUY FLIGHT INSURANCE!!! This is a waste of money, an upsell that WILL NOT guarantee you any money back due to cancelled flights thus you missing an appointment like such as my ICD to be checked, which I missed.

BUY YOUR OWN FOOD AT THE TOM BRADLEY INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL AND BRING IT ONBOARD!!! Food is horrible!!! Believe me I have good taste in food same as you!

AIR FRANCE IS MOST CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR PRODUCT AND SERVICES RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON YOUR CONCERNS. PLEADING FOR ANYTHING IN PARIS, FRANCE AT CDG AIRPORT WON'T DO YOU ANY GOOD.

Too bad the French people in Paris are super nice, the waiters/waitresses  are super nice. The restaurant service is excellent and fast and the food serving is huge! But again too bad with AIR FRANCE'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES they're horrible!!! They're more concerned about their own rather than your needs. When we opted to sleep at the airport, they didn't offer us blankets and pillows instead some snacks which were horrible as well as their service!!! I WOULDN'T FLY AIR FRANCE IF THEY'RE THE ONLY CARRIER IN THE WORLD!!! POOR!!! POOR!!! POOR!!!"|air-france
30|Air France is truly an elegant airline with many flight connections available out of Europe. Paris CDG may be a better hub than London LHR, so AF as the airport host is excellent for connecting flights. Nice meal choices especially for business class and the amenity kit is quite colorful and nice for future use. Happy to see they improve the business class cabin to cubicles and La Premiere on the new 777 aircraft. Courteous staff to help me out flying out SFO, always passionate. Merci, Air France!|air-france
31|"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!
Business class flight from Paris (CDG) to LAX.  Starting with 'Sky Priority' check-in the service on this airline is horrible!  Took over 45 minutes to check-in, because there was only 'one' attendant!  
The flight was almost 12 hours long.. but NO Wifi, Seats did not lay flat, one bathroom in business class section.. they ran out of food for the dinner service.  TOO much money to be treated so poorly!"|air-france
32|8 hour international flight delay, involuntary downgrade, switched airplanes, and lost all of our luggage. Still without luggage and we are flying somewhere else in about an hour. Thanks AirFrance!|air-france
33|"I booked with Delta expecting Air France to be of similar quality. I was wrong. For the price paid to travel in business I'd expect more. To be honest Delta comfort is just as good. Both flights were delayed, for a 10 hour flight SFO - CDG you get offered a drink twice.....

First and last time I'll fly with Air France."|air-france
34|"A fancy in-flight security video doesn't mean the flight is necessarily comfortable and/or the customer service is fancy ! This summer was the first time we were flying Air France, we checked previous reviews and had reservations about booking with Air France. Still we gave them a shot! On our flight back from Europe to USA , our pre-selected seats were changed by the airline and we were seated in the emergency isle. Not complaining, but a notification the least we could expect. The tv screen for the middle seat assigned to us was broken and did not stay in place... we requested to be seated elsewhere as it was a 10 hour flight. Instead we were provided with a ""tape"" to fix the broken Monitor ... once the tape was applied , it became impossible for the person to get out of their seat ( as the screen would not bend anymore!!!). The flight attendant saw us struggling many a multiple times- how it was impossible for us to move around- didn't do anything about it, even after multiple requests!

When we arrived, our luggage was missing. There was no Air France representative available, we had to go to some other counter to get information. Needless to say we never got our luggage back - all the souvenirs gone!!! The amount they reimbursed was useless as it did not even begin to cover the losses we incurred. We had to call them ourselves 10-15 times to inquire about this lost baggage.. they stopped looking for the baggage after a few days- saying it's their policy!!

I would rather pay for an expensive fare than chose Air France ever again!"|air-france
35|"The WORST customer service I have ever experienced.  I was flying from Paris to NYC on an evening flight, and had booked an aisle seat, because of a bad leg.  When I was boarding, I saw my name on the electronic board behind the service desk, asking me to speak to an agent.  No one had paged me.  Now, no one was there, and the flight was boarding.  I spoke to three boarding agents - no one knew what to do, but I got on the plane, and buckled into my seat.

Within 5 minutes a very loud passenger approached me  EXCUSE ME SIR WOULD YOU MIND EXCHANGING YOUR SEAT WITH MY FATHER?  I explained to him that I would rather not, because of my leg injury.  He then yelled WELL MY FATHER HAS A LEG INJURY TOO.  I expressed my sympathy, suggested he speak to an attendant, and hoped he found an appropriate seat for his father.  He then EXPLODED with curses,  anger, and anything you could think of, in the aisle.  I looked to the flight attendants for help.  NO ONE would help.  I was told  ""we do not get involved in seat inquiries between passengers.""  I found that odd, because I SAW the crew help with three other exchanges.  Meanwhile, the passenger was getting louder and louder, and annoying all of the other passengers in the vicinity.  To shut him up, I changed seats.  NO ONE came to speak with me,  through the entire flight.  

I thought it was the crew's job to take care of things like this.  One wonders why they wouldn't help.  I will not fly Air France again.   This was my first trip to France, and this flight nearly ruined it."|air-france
36|I kept seeing a pop up on my screen, Papeete to Los Angeles round trip, 51,000 francs ($510.00 approx)  I clicked on it and went to the site. I tried to make a reservation and it was almost $900. Fraud, plain and simple. they do it all the time. Will never use them. Total fraud. They should be sued.|air-france
37|Very horrible customer service. I wouldn't try them again at all. Definitely recommend anyone thinking of going with air France to cancel it and choose an other airline.|air-france
38|"My husband and I were headed on our honeymoon, two days after our wedding. I was checking us in online in the car to the airport, and because of the confusing layout of the check-in flow, I accidentally selected 2 additional checked bags, and paid $180 total for them.

When we got to the airport I realized my error, and called the 800 support number to seek a refund - We did not have additional bags to check. After being on the phone for about 10 minutes, I was told that I would have to claim my refund from the website, so I emailed from the website. From the website, I was told that I needed to contact a different support center. I emailed the second support center and was told that I needed to call support to claim my refund. When I made the phone call, I was told that I needed to email ANOTHER support line to make this claim. In response to my final email to the THIRD support team, I was told that these fees are non-refundable, and simultaneously, I received another email apologizing for our difficulties, and that they would be forwarding our case to the appropriate teams (not only did they provide incongruous information - there has been no action).

Despite frequent follow ups on our end, we have heard nothing from Air France, or Delta who is supposedly helping us for this claim. It is sickening that they can get away with this. I was told no fewer than three times that Air France COULD refund me for this error, yet they have made it nearly impossible to do so.

Long story short - AirFrance has taken $180 and made it impossible to figure out a refund nor given us a remotely appropriate customer service response. It was not our fault we accidentally paid for extra baggage as their website made it look like it was required. The effort it has taken to get information on this issue makes it seem like AirFrance has intentionally stolen the $180 from us.

We are STILL waiting for a resolution - but wanted to warn other potential customers in the meantime.

We will NEVER fly this airline again."|air-france
39|"Terrible customer service from check in to baggage retrieval.
Staff does NOT care about customers and very disrespectful.  Poor poor airline.
Think twice before booking with airfrance"|air-france
40|"Flew a Boeing 777/200 from Paris to Atlanta.
Was Economy/Coach Class. The seat in front of me leaned so far back into my lap that with
my tray down, I could not stand up the water bottle given by AF. I even had to changed my reg. vision glasses to my readers cause the screen was so close...I had to lower my seat just to accommodate the seat in front of me....8 hrs of this! I couldn't walk down the aisle w/o turning sideways ( I am size 12/14 avg) lest pull a small carry on...they need to change it.
My trip cost over $1300 & this is unfair....."|air-france
41|"Good food and service in the plane, especially with young kids.
Terrible online and on the phone reservation system.  Always making errors, splitting families, unable to process at times.  Horrendous!"|air-france
42|This is the very definition of your worst nightmare for an airline. They destroyed my luggage and refused to pay for it. Numerous calls and efforts and they still didn't take care of it. Customer service was horrible and they are always lying and so rude and obnoxious. The stewardess on the flight  are so racist. The customer service representative were equally racist. The racism of air France has to addressed.|air-france
43|"Air France is a joke! They are so crooked when it comes to checked vs carry on bags! They conveniently use a slightly smaller standard than any other standard carry on luggage.  Thus your standard carry on bags that work in the USA and Asia will NOT fit. What does this mean?  Get your credit card out and stand in line to give them more money to check your carry-ons!   Their staff is typical French rude... go away stupid non-French person.  And boarding... talked about totally inefficient and ineffective. Please come to America and see how it can be done by flying on Southwest Airlines!  If you can avoid it, fly another budget airline.

Update:  If you are buying luggage in the USA, double check your carry-on size.  The USA standard (at least at Costco) is larger than even the TSA regulations, which are larger than the crooked Air France standard."|air-france
44|"Air France is such an amazing airline in Coach. I will go out of my way to fly on Air France from San Francisco. I was first introduced to Air France back in 1998 on my Family's trip to Paris when I was almost 14. Even back then the service was great.

I had an opportunity to fly them internally as well.   Last year when a relative was ill and my Father and I had to fly abroad on a short notice the flights on Air France were amazing. The free flowing Champagne, spirits , and the delicious Poivre(Pear) Liquor) was beyond amazing. All this in coach plus the sandwiches, Lifeways Kefir and Ice Cream in the galley.

Because of the good service I am going out of my way to fly them again this summer from SFO-CDG-SFO on their Airbus 380 which I hear is better than the 777 we were on.

I love the simplicity to checkin online and then go to the Bag Drop at SFO. Everyone is friendly from the team at SFO(including the Air France lounge) to the Flight Crew.

What more  can you ask for watching good movies, listening to good music and sipping on good Red Wine or Champagne that is free flowing. We're not talking Sparkling wine we are talking about the real stuff.  If you know some French you will get even better service.

A simple Si vous plait and Merci with a smile will go a long way.

The price is the same to fly on Delta with a stop but I will drive from my home in the South Bay Area to SFO where customs is a breeze with the Automated Passport Control Kiosk. Checking in at SFO is  very simple and the security lines are not that bad.

I highly recommend taking the first Air France flight especially on a Friday over the second one. Plus you will arrive CDG at 10:40 AM and on the return take the 10:15 AM flight arriving SFO at 12:30 PM.  Yes it means for an early morning but if you can get a shuttle arriving CDG around 6:45-7:30 AM you are good to go.

Yes you may have to pay for a seat assignment. But you can also get it 30 hours before at online checkin but its best to purchase a seat to avoid the middle seat.

Air France has Les Direct Buses from Charles De Gaulle to many points in the  city but if you are 2 or more just take a taxi or shuttle. You can also transfer to Orly.

Some of the reviews on Yelp have said the crew is cold and mean. I have found that to be far from the truth. I love talking to the crew in the galley and practice my French. They are so helpful again knowing some French will get you better service. You will be very pleased that you chose to fly on Air France. With cities throughout the world and codesharing with KLM and Delta you will fly to far away places but be sure when booking a Codeshare that its operated by Air France. Don't get stuck on an Air France flight operated by Delta(I'm not saying Delta is bad as they include alcohol  and other features) but Air France gives you more service for the buck.

This is a tough one.

I love to travel.  I do it often.  I am aware of my favorite and least favorite airlines.  I have actually never traveled with Air France until this month.  Will it be the last time? IDK...

First of all, who does not want to visit Paris, even if it is for an overnight layover?  I kind of scheduled it that way so I could see a little of Paris while I awaited my flight back to the States.  Well, bad idea.  

The flight was ""okay"" and the food was ""okay"" but the flight attendants were jerks at several points throughout the flight.  Now, my mother would say, ""That is because we are French and blah, blah, blah..."" but I think no matter who you are and where you come from--BE NICE!!!

They did get my luggage through safely and securely, the movies offered were great.  I enjoyed my travel space as I upgraded, but I just thought the attendants were SO SUPER RUDE.

Would I fly Air France again?  Not if I have a choice.  

Stephani Slightly Smiles for Air France ;-/"|air-france
46|Idont recommend that flight to any one .. it's not secure especially if u landing in CDG in Paris airport .. it's out of control  no police in airport .. trash air line.. be aware|air-france
47|"Not a great trip with Air France, both on the way to Vienna (transfer at CDG Paris) and on the way back.

The trip there started out ok, however there seemed to be much confusion and the boarding process was much more lengthy due to that. Once on board, the flight to CDG was ok. Three in flight meals from Chicago to Paris. The food was just ok, nothing to write home about and I am glad we were served quite efficiently. There was on board entertainment. Once we made a mad dash due to arriving slightly late in Paris we just made our connecting flight to Vienna.

In Vienna, we discovered that all of our Bags were NOT transferred from Air France to Austrian Airways and we did not get our bags until the following day.

The trip back was worse. We boarded in CDG Paris and my mother-in-law was asked to deplane as she had been selected for a random security check. The attendants were rudely asking her in French to deplane, when I intervened and explained to them in French that she does not understand what they are saying and could I accompany her off the plane? I was told no, that she needed to take her belongings and deplane immediately. Her and another passenger both in their 70's were escorted off the plane only to be brought back on the plane 15 minutes later. They announced afterwards that the flight would be delayed because they had not completed the security check properly.

Once in flight, our entertainment did not work properly. We were unable to watch movies or TV for half of our total flight time. I would definitely not book with Air France again even though their prices were a bit cheaper, it is just not worth it for long flights to skimp."|air-france
48|"The flight itself both ways to and from Paris was smooth, and flight attendants pleasant and efficient.  The issues we had were specific to the airport:
On our flight to Europe via AirFrance we had no issues with any baggage or anything. However, at the CDG airport on our trip home, we ran into a major issue. We were never told, nor was it on our boarding pass - that our carry-on bags had to be 12kg or under limit! We checked in, and the ladies there actually told us to take luggage out of our checked bags because our checked baggage was over 23kg. Why would you tell us that if we cannot have over 12kg on a carry-on?? We were forced to check another bag for $80USD - without warning ahead of time, and there was no way they would let us onto the flight. This is completely unfair, we had to pay for a 3rd bag we were not given advance notice on - which was a nice Tumi suitcase we never check because how nice it is. Of course the bag came out of the trip with many scratches - which was not planned.
On top of this, the entire ordeal was rudely handled - the agents were too busy talking with each other and gave very little direction of what to do. We should not have been charged this extra baggage fee, as we were not made aware this rule even existed. Thanks a lot for a horrible ending to a great trip AF!"|air-france
49|My luggage were delayed in Paris on my flight to Vienna from SFO. The day after they were delivered to me in Vienna and I had no problem getting in touch with air france customer service. They are going to refund me for the clothes I had to buy. Great experience compared to the one I had with Lufthansa last year. Luggage delayed in Munich. I spent probably 120 hours with Lufthansa to locate my luggage. I had to deal with their customer service in the UK. The one in Germany would simply not pick up the phone. They have another one in Asia that has no clue what they are doing. They managed to lose some of them a second time after they have been found. Horror story !! I had to use the call center of united to locate some of these luggage. The first flight was on united. The last luggage was finally sent back to me in SFO but Lufthansa would not tell me because they did not want to pay the delivery service. I had to put a complain to the department of transportation to get them to react. This worked since I got immediately a phone call from them several days after. It took me 2 months to get my luggage back. Therefore, I really appreciate the service I had with Air France.|air-france
50|"I will never book AirFrance again. We flew them from LAX to Paris. Seats are super uncomfortable, meal service is way below average (food quality is terrible) and customer service is very poor. They lost our luggage and getting in touch with any customer service person - might as well forget about it.

Each agent I called asked me to call another number until I got the hint that they just wanted to intentionally make me give up. 5 hours later, they direct you to complete an online form if you have any claim. The page typically times out. If you ever get it to take your information, they inform you that you will receive a confirmation e-mail, which you won't get. Again, the goal is to get you to finally give up.

There is plenty of competition and I would rather pay double than to fly AirFrance again."|air-france
51|"There is a part two to this story because Air France lost my luggage.  The customer service representative specifically said the luggage must travel with the passenger.  She made it a point to take my luggage tag number when issuing my new ticket.   I arrived in Florence with no luggage.  I was told by the airport, my bags were still in Paris.  So not only did I arrive 8 hours late, I had no clothes, etc.  

We kept calling the number provided.  The bags were finally shipped on the last flight of day 2.  I had to take a cab to the airport to pick up.  What a complete pain!   I filed my claim for some expenses.  I finally got an email today from Delta indicating they were handling my claim.  If it is any consolation, I will be reimbursed excluding the cab rides."|air-france
52|"I was traveling to Italy to celebrate my birthday.  I was in a great mood until I started waiting in line to board.  My flight from San Francisco to Paris was delayed 3 hours for mechanical issues.  There were quite a number of passengers who were going to miss their connecting flight.  While in SF, I asked if I could rebook my connecting flight for a later time.  I was told that was impossible until the delayed flight got off the ground.  This is due to their computer system automatically rebooking the connections for us.  

A number of passengers asked the flight crew where to go to rebook our flight.  They had no idea.  They instructed us to talk to the ground grew when we got off the plane.  There were two men there chatting away as we got off the plane.  They just told us to follow the signs for ""Transfers.""  We kept looking for Air France customer service rep's to talk to.  Each one had a different idea about where we should go.  Most of us spent about half an hour frantically walking around the terminal.  We eventually landed in a Customer Service are and waited an hour to get rebooked.  I learned that there was no ""automatic"" rebooking.  In fact, I was placed on standby.  I was told I would have priority.  I reported to the gate and was told a family of 3 was ahead of me.  When the last 3 seats became available, they gave it to 3 business men.  

When I asked about the next flight, they redirected to stand in line for the Customer Service desk again.  I was told if I did not make this flight, my name would transfer to the next flight.  By the time I went back to Customer Service, I will really upset.  I stood in line for about 5 minutes while I saw the Air France employees stand in another area just chatting away.  Then I was told to talk to another Customer Service agent so we could book me on the next flight.  Once again I tell my story of woe to another person.  And 15 minutes later, I got a confirmed ticket.  I'm still not to Florence yet as I am enjoying a meal voucher spent on wine...  Who knows what awaits."|air-france
53|I was flying back from Paris with a friend of mine, and boarding the plane was absolutely chaotic. The flight attendant and gate agents had lines going every which way, and no one seem to know who was supposed to be boarding and when. When we finally boarded the plane and begin to taxi, the plane abruptly stopped, and sat there for the next four hours, and no one bothered to tell us why we were sitting on the runway and not moving.  The pilot finally came on the intercom and told us that there was a problem with the air conditioning unit and he would have an Update for us in 10 minutes, 45 minutes later he finally came back on the intercom and told us that we could not fly on that plane and there were no other flights flying out to San Francisco that afternoon. They brought the plane back to the gate, and proceeded to escort everyone off the plane and told us to all go back to the terminal to rebook our flights. The next four hours were spent standing in line  with the other several hundred people that were on the flight that was canceled. After waiting ANOTHER four hours in line we finally got our turn to speak to the booking agent and were told that we were rebooked the following day on a United airlines flight and that our bags would be sent over to the United ticket counter and we didn't have to do anything else except show up at the airport in the morning.  When we showed up at the airport in the morning the United ticket agent told us that we could not board the plane because the Air France agents did not forward our luggage as they promised,  and we were not allowed to fly without our luggage. We were then sent back over to the Air France terminal to find our own luggage. We spoke to the Air France agent and we were told that we had to go to another terminal to check on our bags, which took an additional 40 minutes . By the time they located our bags it was too late to catch our United flight so back over to Air France terminal we went to be rebooked again. Once we got to the Air France terminal we were told that we could not board that flight either until we had our luggage which was being pulled from the holding bin. So back over to terminal two to check on our luggage before we could get rebooked. We finally got our luggage and we're rebooked on a flight to Los Angeles with a four hour layover, when our original flight was nonstop to  San Francisco. We tried to ask the Air France agent for compensation for all of the canceled flights and re-routing and rebooking and running around looking for our luggage, and we were told they don't do that, because it was a plane malfunction, so we got absolutely nothing for all of the trouble that we went through. I have notified all my friends and family of the horrible service that we received from Air France, and I have vowed  to never fly air France again. Many of the other passengers waiting in line said they would also boycott Air France in the future. I wish I could have given them zero stars, but that is not an option, but they have lost my business as well as my friends and family members for good.|air-france
54|"I will NEVER fly Air France again. They lost our luggage the day we flew, found it almost immediately and sent it to Paris on another flight, where one bag was delivered to us but the other was lost again--our eighteen year old daughter's bag with all of her best clothing, make-up, etc. for her high school graduation trip -- and it was still lost when we left Paris for Barcelona four days later. At the airport in Paris we spoke F2F with a helpful gentleman at baggage services who gathered specific information, problems-solved, and emailed us two hours later that it was located and would be flown to Barcelona that day.  Since then, nothing.  The online lost baggage system gives very few options to actually DO anything about your bags, and the people you reach by phone have a script that consists of ""we are waiting for information and will email (whoever) and inform you promptly"". We have called every day, sometimes twice, and cannot get anyone in the phone to take a personal interest i our situation (unlike the man at the airport) and now it has been NINE DAYS WITHOUT OUR DAUGHTER'S BAG, even though we have confirmation that it is at the Paris airport. We are in Spain and traveling from place to place and then Italy.  This has been the worst travel experience of my life (and I've traveled a lot) in terms of baggage. I recommend you avoid this airline whenever possible."|air-france

56|"This airline and gate attendant are unsettling and unprofessional.
We booked a flight from dallas to Atlanta-Paris.   Because of a flight change on their end took us off a confirmed flight with upgraded seats.
Come to discover they moved us the the next to last row.  Tried to talk to the gate agent about changing the seats and he was rude and condescending.
Telling us oh well ask for a refund.
We do travel quite a bit and have never experienced such an unprofessional airline and attitude.  You lost a couple of customer, but what the heck you don't care about your customers anyway."|air-france
57|"Left Paris on time and arrived in San Francisco on time. cabin crew provided excellent service. Both meals were much better than other airlines that I fly to and from Europe.

58|Roaches on board! I flew to Freetown this past week and had the worst experience flying with Air France. The place was 20+ years old. Seats were old stinky dated fabric that had not been changed.Found a roach crawling all over my things next to me. Flight attendant laughed and said this as normal. Flying economy felt like total discrimination. The majority of people there were African. The service reflected it as well. I flew upgraded economy on the way back and service was equally bad. The plan got stuck in Conakry for over 3 hours because the a/c broke. Makes you wonder about the rest of the plane. A 1st class passenger said this was normal. These flights aren't cheap by any means. I think the safety video they use is very reflective of the mentality. The video shows a group of air headed women taking on a 50's persona. A complete embarrassment to women and where we are today. All around terrible and disappointing!|air-france
59|"Terrible experience. I was 10 minutes late to the baggage closing and they refused to help me. Not only did they not help me at all the guy also YELLED at me about how I should take responsibility. Literally yelled at me and waved me off with his hand while I was crying. Also, I am a missionary to I fly very often and have been a little late for a flight before and I have always been helped. Also, Norwegian airways closes 45 minutes before so obviously it is possible. Next, I went to the desk to try and book a new ticket. I had to wait 10 MINUTES, crying, no line, to let three of the workers finish their chat. I tried to explain what was happening and the lady said ""I don't know anything about that I just book tickets you will have to go back to him for more information"". Then she didn't even apologize or sympathize or have any sense of customer service. Found me a ticket that was over a day from that time and I ended up having to spend over a 1,000 euros to get home. Also, just to point out that this is A LOT of money for a company that clearly has no sense of customer service. I will never fly with them again."|air-france
60|"We booked a round trip from LAX to CDG and paid for it.
This was economy plus.
We got written confirmation of our flights including the seat assignments.
A week before our trip we went to their site and could not find our reservation.
When we called, they said that they had lost us in the system and could not accomodate us.
They offered to fly us on a one stop route instead of our direct flight but would not upgrade us although they admitted we had not done anything wrong and the problem was on their end."|air-france
61|"Air France is a horrible company with literally the worst customer service. They've basically threw away my bags and refused to do anything. They're call center is a bunch of incompetent lazy people that don't do anything other than answering the phone. Their ""social media team"" is a robot that sends you back template answers. They don't have any escalation path for their customers to talk to a single person who cares. They don't care about your property. Avoid this airline by any cost and if you have to keep your stuff in carry on bag and just bring a 30 pounds dumbbell with you and give it to baggage (that's what I'm gonna do from now on)."|air-france
62|You bumped me off a flight from Paris to SF leaving me stranded for another 24 hours in paris missing my sisters wedding back home. I booked this flight months ago, and was confirmed. Upon arriving at Charles De Guelle, I was told I was suddenly on stand by. I got next to no info and was directed to the gate. I stood on stand by for 3 hours until you rudely said I couldn't make it. Oh, and you held the flight so another delayed flight with connecting passengers could make it. I was scheduled to take AF 082 departing at 355 from Paris on July 9. I now have to wait until a 10am flight tomorrow on July 10. I hate your company, and your disgusting abuse and greed. I will never travel with your airline, you are a disgrace and a sham. YOU ARE WRONG AND AN UNETHICAL COMPANY!|air-france

64|"Seriously?  Skip Air France if possible.  Seriously.  I just returned from a great trip to France and Barcelona.  Tickets were booked months ahead for me, my parents and 92 year old grandma.  Upon checking in, (we always arrive hours ahead of boarding!) we were informed our seats had been changed on our non stop to Paris, as the plane was changed.  Hello?  They did not e-mail us any update, in the months between purchasing the tickets and date of departure.  We now had three seats together and one a few rows up and on the other side of the large plane.  So, my dad had to ride alone for 10 hours.  They said they could not do anything.  Really?  What good does it do to book tickets months ahead?  Why even save seats if it doesn't mean a thing?  The young man at least gave us priority boarding, which was nice.  

Coming back from Barcelona, connecting flight for my granny and I in Paris to SFO, was the same.  This time, all the seats were spread out, even though we needed an aisle seat for my grandma, so she could stretch out her leg.  I mean, really?  You can't even give us a seat for my 92 year old grandma to stretch her leg?  At least on the flight from Paris to SFO we still had our two seats together with an empty one in between (by chance).  

If you ever have a connecting flight at the Charles de Gaulle  airport, make sure you have enough time in between!  When we arrived, we had to off board down stairs outside.  A bus took us to the inside of the airport.  We then had to wait in a huge line to get on a bus to get to the terminal.  We then had to walk a ways to the gate, which by the time we got there there were hundreds of people in line.  That was it for me.  I asked a lady with the airlines if we could priority board, as my grandma is 92!  She asked someone, and they said it was fine.  

The food and movie selection were pretty good, as well as the hospitality of the flight attendants.  I would never fly this airline again, unless there wasn't another option.  They don't keep your booked seats, even if you are a family with an older person and don't seem to care.  Good luck Air France, I would be surprised if they last much longer."|air-france
65|"Non-stop from SFO to CDG.
Long line at the counter, 90 minutes waiting in-line and barely made it to the cut-off.
Main issue was checked luggage. Delayed luggage at departure. was first located in SFO (1st message from AF Luggage Department AFLD) and put on next day flight to CDG (2nd and LAST message from AFLD) ... where it just disappeared ! Since then, no update from AFLD despite 2 calls a day (I am a French speaker), and it has been 4 days ! Speaking to AF employee I met in the CDG coffee shop, it seems that AF Terminal 2E had major issues with its sorter ('trieur') machine and that about 5,000 'zombie suitcases' have been redirected WITHOUT ENTRANCE SCANNING to a 'dark zone' wharehouse 'Le Cube'. They lie there in limbo, ignored because they cannot be traced, and wait for the sorter to get well ... or for a brave soul to go in with a hand-held scanner and do a job that nobody cares about. It also seems that this happens a lot at Terminal 2E according to the web. AF, why don't you address it right now ... or do you want to reach epic failure in a few years during the Olympics in Paris ?
Too bad, because food and crew on board were delightful :-)"|air-france
66|They should change their name to Lost Language Airline..this is the second time they lost mine..I don't think anyone in management cares either. They never responded to my first review, it's ok I'm not giving up on you.. you'll get one star ratting until you put your sh.. together. By the way I'm writing this inside plane waiting for a gate to open up (20 min) so far. I guess they had no idea there is a flight coming in.|air-france

Lost objects :    Laptop - MacBook 2016 Color - rose gold Brand - apple Size - 12
inches With charger white Chevron pink and gray color case
Place of loss :    Laptop was sitting on the Seat in the flight - seat number 20K
Other details :    The flight attendant didn't not cooperate and straight away
denied any help. She said to file an online report while I was standing there and
she could have gone back and looked. It's a shame. I believe it was stolen by
the crew or helping crew cause they seemed guilty and mad to even respond to
the request. They did not give their names or didn't call the manager on duty
despite being asked several times. Despite several attempts they did not help or
directed. The kid was crying for 7 hours (until she got on the Delta airline plane
to Cincinnati ) for help but no one attended her. I was on the phone with her she
begged the attendant to talk to her mom (me) but she won't. She couldn't find
any department called 'lost n found' inside the airport area where she got off to
file the complaint cause everyone kept saying that she has to exit the airport to
get to that department and to exit  she needs Paris visa. The police didn't even
pay attention to her for even once. Every single person she approached did
help blew her off. Imagine a little child 13 years old being treated that way !! It's
a shame.
She was only instructed to file an online complaint by an Indian wheelchair
helper at the airport which I did but again how silly is that to file an online
complaint while you're there!! Right there.
They were so mean to her, she was completely traumatized by this experience
and her tiny self was crushed by their rudeness alone besides the pain of losing
her brand new laptop that was a gift from her grand dad. Her faith in humanity
just went down by leaps n bounds I am sure. I am seeking justice in this matter
and I am sure cameras could find who took it. There must be a way to find it I
know that. These thefts are not really minute. It was a mac book pro brand new
and a lot more expensive than the return flight itself. As a single mom I seek
justice for my little girl. I request that the airline must either find that MacBook or
replace it with the same model. I bet all this could be seen in the camera a
little girl running all over the airport with her mom on the phone with her.  hope
that discrimination was not the reason for this treatment with her. I really seek
justice in this matter and an apology from those two crew members who shooed
my daughter shooed away several times.

68|"Air France has a very bad Baggage Service customer service. I traveled from San Diego to JFK, Paris, then Tunis. I landed on August 16th in Tunis and it took them three days to deliver two of my bags. During the three days I had to call the French Baggage service four times and had them send three urgent messages. Also, I got some help from someone in Tunis airport who sent a telex to France. The Baggage Service is really bad and not very helpful. All they can do is read you back what you can see on their website and the only value they can provide is send an urgent message. You cannot escalate the issue with them, you cannot talk to a supervisor, they claim they cannot call anyone either. They strictly work with email and you have to be patient and wait for your bags to show-up whenever they show-up. There are at least three daily Air France flights from Paris to Tunis and it took them three days for two 50lbs bags to show-up. Now it is my fifth day and I am still waiting for my last bag.
For verification, my claim number is TUNAF58395 and my Air France flight confirmation number is R6XXPT.
They talk about their policy of a 100 euro as if it is a solution for everything, but they neglect the fact that they could be ruining a wedding event etc... and when I told the customer service this, he said he cared, but was not doing anything for it.

70|"Our flight was OK but not great. We were in Economy class and we paid premium for exit row seats. I know I need to lose some weight but the seats were just uncomfortable and 10 hours of uncomfortable is not fun. I've flown Lufthansa and KLM and both had better seats and amenities when flying internationally.

The flight attendants were nice enough and food was okay. Would I fly Air France again? Possibly, if I fly business class."|air-france
71|"Never again.

AirFrance employee at CDG closed the gate 5 minutes early, nearly blocking us (and at least 8 other people) from making our connection despite knowing that we were all present at the airport (having flown AirFrance to get there, and having booked our entire itinerary through AirFrance). The only reason we were allowed on board is because my mother, who flew in earlier and was on board even as we were running up to the gate, spoke with the flight attendant and the captain of the plane was literally waiting around for us to board. The gate person was horribly rude, and completely unhelpful. I would almost say she was being malicious.

AirFrance then proceeded to lose not only our bags (almost understandable given the short connection) but my parents bags as well (NOT acceptable, they were at the airport 3 hours, plenty long enough to load some bags on a plane). They couldn't even tell us where my mother's bag was. No follow up to make sure we received our luggage whatsoever.

AirFrance then lost my sister's bag on her way back through CDG to the states.

AirFrance is not worth the money. You will be treated way better with British Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, or probably literally any other airline in their price bracket."|air-france
72|Will never fly Air France again. Strike cancelled my Toronto to Sofia flight the day before. AF could not get me to Sofia for three more days.  I would miss prepaid hotel and guides. Had to rebook last minute with Air Canada. Their strike cost me an additional $1400. Would rate them 0 stars if possible.|air-france
73|"Air France is a formerly good airline which had a rough period and is now trying to return to former goodness (I'd hesitate to say they were ever great, and they probably never will be great again).

The SFO operation is fine. The lounge is pretty meh, but if you can get into the Delta Sky Club, it's marginally better.  SFO is a reasonable first-world airport, so the airline doesn't really have to do much there.

In flight experience is mixed. The AF hard product (seats in Business, aircraft, etc.) is kind of meh -- old 777s and 747s badly in need of refresh, and no lie-flat seats in Business.  The soft product: cabin crew, pilots, catering, etc. are all really good, in my experience.  They've really improved catering in the past couple years.  In general AF J is superior to UA C/F.  SQ, CX, etc. still crush them.

CDG, however, is another story. It's the worst designed (well, evolved, not really designed) major airport I've visited. No useful signage; traveling to a lounge required going through a lot of unmarked doorways, and I went through customs several times going airside to groundside to get between terminals.

CDG lounges are full of obnoxious screaming European children (generally from Italy and Spain; not French and not American), so you get to deal with that while waiting for connecting flights.

Really, just stick to BA, Virgin, or Lufthansa for European flights, especially in premium cabins, and you'll be happier.  LHR isn't a great joy either, but BA and VS are good airlines. Really they're all pretty mediocre compared to the Middle Eastern and Asian carriers; Europe and the US really need to step their game up when it comes to commercial aviation."|air-france
74|"I am not sure if others are as bad, but they allow one carry on and a small item for any class, including business class and 1st class when flying internationally to/from the USA.  Also the size limitation is 21"" X 13"" x 9"".  I was looking for a rolling garment bag and all of the ones I looked at were 14"" and not 13!  The charges for extra baggage are approximately $100 etc....."|air-france
75|"Horrible customer service at airport counters. Dealing with Air France at SFO and Istanbul was like dealing with zombies bent on giving me the worst experience possible.  Rude, bureaucratic, and unapologetic.  Complaints to their ""customer care"" people via AF's website generated equally rude and unapologetic responses.  Avoid Air France if you possibly can!  Not worth the stress and headaches.

Air France's ""service"" is as bad as they come!"|air-france
76|"Absolutely horrible experience attempting to purchase tickets from Air France. During payment processing their site had an issue and stated booking not complete but reservation made. They performed a pre-authorization aganst my bank, locking nearly $5K in funds as pending auth. More than anxious to actually purchase the tickets, I was told by Air France/ Delta that a fax could be sent to my bank to clear the hold. 1st time - lie, no fax sent and no notes of our conversation. 2nd time - ""form completed and fax sent, confirm with your bank recieved"" (no fax) 3rd time - whoever told you a fax could be sent wasn't correct, and they are in a different center with no way to ID who they are or reconnect you with them. 3 days of 8+ calls trying to clear with no progress.

The funds for the flight were set aside in a specific to the purchase, so unable to re-attempt payment or book other tickets as the funds are unavailable. No resolution offered from the Air France/ Delta team, and had to fight to get them to even extend having them honor the reservation. Given 6 days to finalize payment, where funds are locked for another 4 - with hope that release occurs immediately. Seem to care little as to whether they complete the sale - and frankly they likely won't should I find similar flights with another airline."|air-france
77|"I flew them recently from SFO to Paris CDG , then to Bangalore and back again. They aren't the worst airline, but they cannot handle most basic comfort and convenience issues. I have been flying for over 25 years now, and Air France is at the bottom 3 of my top ten, with Singapore, Emirates and Cathay being the top 3.

Here are my issues:

1. Family of 3 with a 5 and a 7 year old. We weren't seated together on the return leg. 3 calls to the customer service got me nowhere and a lot of 'don't care if you don't like us' attitude. Originally the seats were together; they changed the seats on the fly to separate us. Then they wanted 22$ per seat 'coz those were the only ones they had together at that time'. May I mention we called them almost 25 days prior to our flight date? I was really upset that even though we had called in more than 3 weeks prior to our return leg's departure, all seats were already taken, supposedly.

AF - Are you guys running a scam here or what?

2. Special veg meal was ordered, was confirmed, and then got non veg regular meals on the return leg - coz somehow, my name 'wasn't on the list'. The request was made when we initially bought our tickets. One leg was fine, return was not. How is that possible? Lucky I eat non veg, otherwise it would have been bad.

3. Lastly, they advertise that they let you 'choose you seat' online 30 hours before the flight. Don't trust that the seats will be available! Unlike British Airways, who's similar feature allows you to pick your seat among many available, Air France's seats were already mostly taken, (for every leg) and this is exactly 30 hours prior to the flight! (I always pride myself in being among the first to login, check in and try to assign my seats as soon as they are available online)

There were numerous other issues: big, square IFE boxes which are floor mounted on their A330 on B,D,G and J seats. (almost all rows with those seats have them!) They rob about 40% legroom. Floor mounted IFEs have been phased out at most major airlines. Not Air France.

In CDG we broke our journey for a week, to vacation in Paris. (Great city, BTW) when we arrived to board our onward flight at CDG to Bangalore, we found no agents to manually help us with our baggage tags. We had checked in online, but they wouldn't provide human support to give us our boarding passes either! ( at SFO as well as Bangalore, there were agents who tagged our bags, and gave us boarding passes, but not at CDG!). This resulted in a long line of confused passengers booked on various flights trying to print their tags and boarding passes at the 'self service' kiosks. For someone who hasn't manually tagged their own check in bags, the tags aren't that easy to put on!

I get that Air France saves money by having self serve kiosks, but what about the poor passenger with young kids? They are left to stand in a long line, not knowing how to tag the bags, and enduring other annoyances such as unhelpful agents when requesting any info! All this, at their main airport, Paris CDG? Good god!

Too many issues adding up. I am not flying them again, ever."|air-france
78|I would give 0 stars if I could. Flew from LAX( Los Angeles) to CDG (France) with Air France on May 15th. When my cousin and I arrived to France none of our luggages were at the airport. We even spoke with a representative from Air France when getting on our connecting flight at San Francisco airport to verify our luggages would arrive in France when we did. NOPE. That never happened. So we spent the following days scrambling to find clothes rather than sightseeing. I was supposed to go to a wedding and I had no clothes for the occasion. Then two days after my arrival in France, four of my other family members arrived with Air France as well. They all lost their luggages. How can you do that on two separate flights??? The amount of carelessness from this airline is outrageous. So we spent the following days all shopping for necessities. Our family trip was definitely ruined because of this mishap. I have tried to speak with representatives on the phone regarding this matter so we may be reimbursed in some way. Everyone just tries to redirect you right back to their online complaint form so they don't have to deal with you. So far I have heard nothing back from the airline in efforts to correct their problem. Thanks Air France.|air-france
79|The check in process is the worst of any airline, even if you are just dropping off your baggage , it is still the same line and an average wait of 44 minutes.One of the worst airlines|air-france
80|"Posting this in case anyone else has trouble submitting delayed baggage reimbursements on the AirFrance site. The form does not give you any error messages, so it's difficult to figure out what went wrong when you click submit and it just returns a blank form. 1) Attachments must be less than 2MB, 2) I had to use Internet Explorer before it would work.

Loved Air France until my bag was misdirected at CDG. It was found 2 hours after I landed, but I didn't get it back until 4 days later. During that time, I received lectures from their customer service on being patient. The incompetence of their web site was the last straw."|air-france
81|Worst customer service of any airline in the business.  They stole 200 dollars from me for a bag fee for a nonexistent bag that I didn't check and then condescended to me on twitter about it.  It's a lying, cheating, thieving company, and I hope it goes out of business.|air-france
82|"My niece who is twelve was on summer vacation to seattle for about one month to visit her mother, during the flight coming to seattle everything went OK she had helped through out the flight, had her paperwork done correctly and was on her way. So when the day arrived for her to leave to go back to france we all showed up three hours early waited in that horrible long ass line and when we made it up to the counter the check in lady said ""it is to late you should have showed up three hours early"" all of us looked at each other and we explained to her we were in line the whole entire time arriving three hours early, frustrated and pissed off cause it seem like they just up this little girl seat to someone else, we asked for the manager he wasn't able to do anything other then give her mom a $300 dollar voucher for this incident, so she missed her flight and they re-booked the flight for the following day. Her father in france had paid $400 for a special service to accompany this child on that flight not only did they rip him off cause there was no one to accompany this girl to her plane, my wife had to go and do it herself. So the next day we all left early at 9:30am cause her flight leaves at 1pm just to play it cautious, we get to the counter through that long ass line again and still after paying an extra $400 dollars we still got no help or service and on top of that my wife had to take a photo for proof for my niece father to know that this airline did not lie to her dad about the special accompany service they were suppose to do, they also lied telling all of us she didn't need to be walked in cause they were suppose to have someone walk with her then they switched it up and told us that the parent will be arrested if not accompany with the child? WTF!! AIR FRANCE is the most Horrible,dishonest,lying, Airline. I hope someone sues this airline so they get there stuff together and learn about better customer service."|air-france
83|"I booked a roundtrip flight from SFO to Italy using Delta. The flight back connected from Italy to Paris, CDG and was operated by AIr France. Compared to Delta's plane and crew, I loved my experience flying with Air France. The crew was very very friendly and constantly provided flight updates. The seats were comfortable, I loved the entertainment options. There were SOOOOO many movies I had a hard time deciding which ones to pick (always a good problem to have on an 11 hour flight). As far as airplane food goes, it wasn't terrible either. And I like that when you ask for wine, they give you the entire mini bottle :)

Flight was smooth and we actually landed 50 min earlier than expected! The back of my bag was broken somehow (the plastic part that lines it, where the handle retracts into), but I wrote in and received a check pretty quickly!

Since I didn't experience any problems, I can't speak for what everyone else is saying, but I have taken other international flights and compared to those (especially United - I can't believe they don't offer screens for each flyer in int'l economy, that is a JOKE to me. You also get food more frequently when you fly with Delta/Air France), Air France is a great option. I still think Virgin Atlantic is my favorite."|air-france
84|"This review is for the seat selection process. I booked a flight from SFO to CDG many months before the flight date. No seat could be assigned at the time. I tried a few months before the flight and was informed that the company holds most of its seats until 30 hours before the flight. We would have to select seats when we checked in online or at the airport.

At 30 hours I went online to check in but because it was a flight from the U.S., I had to wait until 24 hours before. At 23 hours before (was tied up at work for that first hour), I checked in and the only two seats available together we're at the very back of the plane. I called the airline and thy suggested that I try to change it at the airport gate.

At the airport gate I was told there were no available seats to change to.

So my question is, how the hell did all the other hundreds of passengers get their seats reserved while we couldn't?

We are just praying we don't miss our connection."|air-france
85|"I flew from San Francisco to London via Paris on AF 83 on June 25, 2015.

I had been tracking the AF flights for that week and all were seriously late departing SFO.

That was no exception to my flight.

I must say the on board service was good and the flight attendants were very pleasant.

I travel on Business many times a year to Europe mostly on British Airways and Lufthansa.

This time I tried Air France.

The flight was late departing San Francisco which meant that my connection which was 1 hour and 50 minutes at Paris was reduced to 20 minutes.

The boarding process at SFO was like a cattle stampede

When I opened the sealed bag that contained the comforter, the smell that came from there was PUTRID. The comforter smelled like the previous person who had used it had VOMITED on it and that it was not properly washed after that.

The flight was full so there were no extra blankets to sleep with.

On arrival in Paris I had 20 minutes to make the connection flight , which I did make , mostly because I am an experienced traveler and know how to negotiate the terminals.

My luggage of course did not make the connection flight.

On my arrival at Heathrow I reported to the AF missing luggage counter and filled out the missing luggage form.

My scheduled arrival in to London was 135pm and I had given myself 7 hours of time to account for possible delays before my business dinner that evening.

The AF baggage representative advised me that my luggage would be arriving into London on the next Air France flight from Paris at 420pm and that he would arrange for a priority delivery of the bags to my hotel in central London by no later than between 630pm and 7pm that evening.

My luggage arrived at about 9pm , which meant that I had to quickly go out and purchace clothes for the dinner that evening as I had nothing else to wear.

My Bag arrived and the right wheel which was built in to the construction of the bag (not hanging loosely on the outside of the bag ), had been RIPPED out of the bag rendering it useless to travel with.

This meant that I had to purchase a new suitcase the next morning in London.

When I called Air France In London to tell them what happened they said I must find a baggage repair place somewhere in London on Saturday or Sunday and have them repair the unrepairable bag .Such places are closed on weekend days. I was scheduled to leave London on Monday morning. Air France had just given me the brush off.

The damage done to the luggage was so severe that the force with which it was handled must have been with extreme violence.

So the reader can asses the report themselves.

1. Late flights all week long from SFO.

2. Boarding handled like a cattle ranch.

3. Business Class blanket was filthy.(disgusting)

4. Almost missed connection.

5. Luggage missed connection flight.

6. Luggage delivered after promised time.

7. Luggage destroyed by Air France.

WOW 7 strikes !! that's a LOOSER for a 1st time flight with Air France

That was the first and last experince I will ever have with Air France. Good luck to all those who fly them.

I'll stick to British and Lufthansa for the hundreds of times Ive flown them , I have never had a such a HORRIFIC experience.

Trust me avoid Air France if you possibly can"|air-france
86|"Air France Premium Economy is a joke.  There is nothing premium about it. Flew Minneapolis to Charles De Gaul on an A340 returning CDL to JFK on an A380. Outgoing flight seats were very uncomfortable. Almost zero padding and no possibility of sleep.  TV's are a joke. Food is the same as economy No special service of any kind.  Return trip on the  A380 the food was slightly better but still economy.  Seats the same.  
Don't waist your money."|air-france
87|"I arrived to check in and my baggage was 15kg...this is my carry on and personal item combined. They made me check it for being 3 kg over the 12kg limit. They charged 30euro for that, but they didn't charge my friend because they had last his baggage on the way to Paris a few days ago. I am travelling with him and it was an inconvenience to me as well, however they refused to waive out the charge for me too. I even spoke to a manager named stefanie and she said ""you have to pay, this is where this conversation ends"" no way to treat customers."|air-france
88|"My 3rd & last Air France flight.  I'd give zero stars.  I sincerely recommend that if you are planning to fly to Paris, take another airline company.

Fast details:

*Fly to Paris.  Leave late, arrive late.
*Arrival: After 3.5 hours waiting for luggage to come up the belt, it does not appear.  4 other people on the flight  also do not get thier luggage.
*Luggage is lost for 4 days!  I call 2X per day.  ""Your bags are not here, do not call again, we will call you"" - Says Air France.
*Day 4 - I take train back to airport, meet Air France baggege manager.  My luggage has been in a giant pile holding area for 3 days, I get my luggage.  No apology, no vouchers.

* 21 days later - Return trip home to San Francisco: Get on line @ 8:45 am for 10:40 flight.  Snake thru line.  Get to counter  ""Your flight is closed, we can not get you on the jet"" - They say. ""WHAT?""
* I argue with the operations director for 4 hours to get me on a flight that day.  I am reasonable, they are not.  They ask for 3,305 euros to put me on a plane to Atlanta Georgia!  I argue for 3 more hours, I  fly to Seattle for 730 euros more than I already paid for my original ticket to SFO.  I pay another $200 to fly from Sea-Tac to SFO.

Moral of story.   Never fly Air France again,  Tell everyone to avoid Air France.   In the future, take British Airways to London, take train to Paris or fly Ryan air.

Sincere wish:  Air France goes broke and disappears."|air-france
89|I wish I can give them minus 5,this is the worst company to travel with .don't waist your time and money with them.|air-france
90|"Not sure how many stars to give them...this is only for the Air France SFO ground service staff...

We packed light, no check-in luggage...just needed to use the self service ""machine"" to check in and get our boarding passes printed.   One asks, what can possibly go wrong???  Well...

The machine did NOT print...I asked the customer service young man...he said just wait...I've waited for over 15 minutes...please just wait a little more.  5 more minutes?  I waved him down and asked if he can get some technical help...obviously the machine is NOT working...ok, he says...I will spare you the details...because this took more than an hour and a half of torture...

After directing us to another self service machine and NOTHING but the first leg of the trip printed...he had the gall to send us to WAIT IN LINE!!!!!  If we knew the machines are out of order, we would have waited in line the moment we arrived at SFO!!!!

Lined up we did...I made sure to complain to two ladies who were great...they deserve 5 stars...Rosa and Linda...

Turns out the young man is new to the job...WHY in the world would AF not train someone properly, I cannot understand...thumbs down for them...poor kid...3rd day on the job...

Aside from that:

AF offers the connecting flight to Florence via Paris...but connection cuts too close...we almost missed boarding.

The flight attendants are great on the plane aside from a male attendant on the first leg...food was not great but never expected good food on any economy flights...

Sadly, we don't have much choice if we need to fly into Florence, Italy..."|air-france
91|I actually like flying air France. the flight crew is lovely, service is great and the amenities are OK.|air-france
92|Actually the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. I fly often, I'm 23 years old and Air France was a recommendation from a friend and I thought I'd give them a try on a long distance from LAX to Queen Alia in Jordan. From before the departure flight to now I have hated the entire experice. They changed our departure flight without informing us, changing our seats to regular seats when I had paid for seat plus. The service on the plane was awful. The seating arrangement was MORE THAN AWFUL. the regular economy seats don't have room to even stretch your ankles. I ended up having to contact their return service to get my money back for the seats I paid for and didn't get to sit in. That took forever to deal with. On the flight from France to Amman I didn't get my seat plus seats and those were like regular Virgin America seats. You get maybe 2 or 3 more inches of space in front of you. I shouldn't have to pay extra for ordinary seats. Now my trip is almost over and my return flight takes off tonight. I wanted to purchases extra baggage as I've accumulated a lot of gifts. They said to purchase online, that it would be cheaper. I got a notification while I was checking in online to buy my extra baggage options. And I signed up with their flying Blue card so I'm supposed to get some discount when I buy the baggage online. After working on this for an hour, it turns out I'm not a ALLOWED to buy any baggage options online...what? Then why do you advertise the discount? False advertising. Awful service. Awful online/app capabilities. Awful seats. Awful customer service on the phones. I had a single good experice with the woman at the check in counter at LAX. I wish I got her name. Otherwise this whole trip was ridiculousness. I would never recommend and I will never fly with them again.|air-france
93|This is my first time putting a bad review regarding AirFrance. My flight with air france from Paris to NY, carrying 2 kids (2,5 years and 9 months was just horrible) This was on August 23, 2018. First of all, I had to carry my 9 months old during the 9 hours of my flight, as the bassinet was very tight for him, and I had to take care of 2.5 years with one hand. No one from the cabin crew tried to help, in fact, they were looking at me very weird, it's like I did something bad. Even when I asked them to bring the bassinet in the begging, she gave me a bad face. I struggled alone during my 9 hours without any, any any help. Then la cerise sur le gateau, I had a couple seating next me, who tried to change their seats as soon as they saw my babies, but the flight was full. My 2.5 almost threw up when we started out landing, they started screaming at me, both adults, they were saying we pais for our tickets, it's OK we all did, even my baby. Excuse me if you are seating next to strange people (Kids). The cabin crew DIDN'T DO ANYTHING to intervene. I felt alone among monsters who don't like seating next to innocent people. Plus when the plane landed and everyone left the cabin. The people from the cabin crew were all standing in front of me, and no one offered to help me to take our my luggage from the above cabinet. One of the passanger felt sorry for me and he did it. Bottom line, be careful when you travel with your kids with AIRFRANCE. Thank you AIRFRANCE for your discrimination. Merci|air-france
94|"I'm sorry, but this airline SUCKS.

I flew direct from SFO to Paris...BOTH directions reminded me of a ghetto version of an international airline.  I usually experience these kind of piss poor standards on local flights.  But international?  Puhleeze.  

The food is atrocious.  

Legroom?  Forget it!  And I'm only 5'1"".  Pathetic.

Somehow, I got stuck in a seat where the video screen didn't work.  For 3 hours I had to mooch off of others' TV despite several complaints to the staff.

What else can I say...Air France has to do a lot more than offer some free used headphones, airplugs, and bad wine.  Free stuff comes with every international flight I've ever been on, so big freaking whoop.  

Pay a little more and get on another carrier!"|air-france
95|"Where should I even start? To prologue this review I should mention that before experiencing the wonder that is AirFrance, I was kind of having the worst day on my trip. TigerAir was just horrible: $4 for drinks, $40 for checked luggage. Ick! Before departure on TigerAir I prepared my belongings to be carried on because I really didn't want to check in any bag and pay $40. Long story short, security didn't like what I was bringing on board so I got detained and ended up missing my flight. So many things went wrong from there, but I suppose all worked out eventually, especially because I was blessed with having to take a later flight to my destination under AirFrance. I don't know if it was because of sudden contrast from terrible to way above-average, but everything about this airline blew me away!
First of all, I've never seen so many crew members serving such a tiny flyer population on board before! The isles were delightfully filled with men and women who were serving a full-blown meal and drinks on a 1.5-hour flight! We barely got off the ground and everyone's cups were filled and laughter filled the cabin. I asked for OJ, which they didn't have right then and there, so I said I'll have a coke instead. Before I knew it, my table had a coke and an OJ. I don't even recall seeing how it got there!
Second of all, the crew was super professional: they greeted us while we were boarding. Not just the captain; every crew member was standing and smiling as we walked down the isle. ""Bonjour!"" everywhere!
Thirdly, the bathrooms were the cleanest I've seen on any aircraft during all my years of travel. I felt like I was in first class with the roominess and cleanliness. We had a private TV screen, comfortable leather-eared headphones, amazing service, and so much leg room!
Fourth, their prices from Singapore to Jakarta were the cheapest in kayak.com. I use kayak to search for cheap flights and so far it hasn't let me down. AirFrance was cheaper than TigerAir! And with all the pros listed above, it seriously is a wonder how they stay in business.
As a minimalist traveler, I like to legally steal from hotels and airlines, especially their pillows because they are portable and comfortable. I actually felt guilty even thinking about stealing from AirFrance. They deserve every penny I gave them for my wonderful experience and I wouldn't think about taking anything from them. Go me!

Anyways, this wasn't my first time on AirFrance. From what I recall, they consistently please me with their service. It's just now that I am bringing this to my conscious."|air-france
96|"Not bad but there's room for some improvement. My boyfriend and I had to fly from SFO to LAX to CDG (Paris). We purchased Premium Economy tickets which I found worth it. Overall our flights were very comfortable and smooth. For Premium Economy (sky priority) you get to have a nice short wait to board in a different line, not economy. Fantastic! When we found our seats, there were conveniently place pillow and blankets and bottled water. We received a make up bag containing socks, sleep eye mask, toothbrush, etc. For premium economy, the main course is the same but the sides/dessert are a lot better (compare marinated shrimp cocktail versus cole slaw). Good selection of movies to watch.

Service and food:
-The flight attendants were VERY nice and attentive.
-Food wasn't too bad, but then again, I'm not a foodie.

Some downsides:
-They changed our return flight time (3 hours earlier) 9_9 and changed our seat selections. Not cool since the idea was to pay more to get the seats we wanted.
-Online check in not guaranteed to work. Finally I was able to get in but then they said there was an error and that we'd have to visit the desk associate at bag check in. Never really understood why other than they overbooked our connecting flight from LAX to SFO.
-I experienced delays on these flights. (captain drove away from the gate only to realize a door was open and having to drive all the way back)
-Takes forever to get off the plane after landing...really.

If I choose to fly to Europe again I may look at other airlines before trying Air France again. I was pleasantly surprised though considering I had read many many negative reviews on their airline and expecting the worse."|air-france
97|"My boyfriend surprised me and upgraded us from premium to business class.  We hung out at the lounge in SFO and although they had champagne and a nespresso type machine they totally lacked in food items.  We ate some sandwich squares and lays chips.  How French is that?

The flight itself was amazing.  Sooo comfortable up in business and I was surprised to find out that first class was only available in the jumbo planes usually coming to and from Japan.  I guess I won't be experiencing first anytime soon.

Another thing that rocks is the direct flight from SF to Paris.  I hate connecting flights.  There weren't any problems while on board; everyone was super nice and attentive.  We flew back in premium and although the seats weren't as nice the service was still very good.

My boyfriend's family lives in France so I'm glad I had such a good experience with them since we'll be flying back fairly often."|air-france
98|"I am a French transplant to California and have been flying once a year for the last 20 years. Initially and when it was just me, it was fine. However, now that i fly with my children it's a nightmare. The rudeness and lack of help for people is unbelievable.

This particular time, i am flying with my 2 kids, 8 and 17 months, with the latter on my lap. They stuck me in a regular row and when i called to talk about that, i had the following conversation with a rep who sounded like i was bugging him:

Me: Can you move me to the upper deck where Economy has only 2 seats on the side.
AF: No it's a preferred seats for special customers (i.e not me!)
Me: Well i have been flying your airline once a year for 20 years that doesn't make me special?
AF: No it's for people in a different pricing category
Me: You mean i paid such a low price i don't qualify?
AF: yes

You know, i am used to French customer service but this is BAD. Make your customers pay a premium and then tell them they are crap..."|air-france
99|"I am French but have lived in San Francisco for the last 15 years. I have flown back and forth about 22 times since. I used to only fly United when they had a non-stop and NEVER had one problem. However, they canceled the non-stop and i had a baby, which means that my goal is to travel from point A to point B as fast as possible and therefore my only option is Air France.

Everytime i book a flight i cringe that i have to give that much money for such bad service. French flight attendants are like all french employees..they want to do the least amount possible and only care about their benefits (believe me i know!). So they only like single passengers who never ask for anything, barely move and watch movies on their iphones. If you have a special request, need help, order a special meal or god forbid have a child, they will treat you like crap the entire time. Because of course you are interfering with their desire to do nothing.
I have only traveled with a child post 911 and my #1 goal is to need nothing from no one. I have never asked to have a bottle warmed, never asked for ANYTHING at all. Yet, when they bring my SLEEPING kid his special kid meal (oops there i go..something special) they just drop it and turn around. So he eats cold when he wakes up. It has happened all 3 times we have gone since he can eat and they have never offered to come back. Last time my american husband, who doesn't know you never argue with a french employee, asked them to take it back. You should have seen their faces.
We went to the back of the plane for the snacks that are offered (but not delivered) in the middle of the flight. My 4 year old asked politely in french if he could have something and they just gestured toward him to help himself.
Did i mention that the plane is usually late, that, like 20 years ago you have to take a BUS to the plane..i could go on and on. It's service only a french person could stand because they are used to it. Guess i have lived here too long.
Yet next months i will be torturing my whole family with this rotten airline again. avoid"|air-france
100|"Do not ever ever ever book a flight on Air France that is operated by Alitalia. It is the classic Catch 22. I booked two premium economy seats. The site noted I could not book seats till check in (! Right! and get the dregs). As a frequent traveler, I knew I could call the airlines to get my seats. AF said, ""Nope. Gotta call Alitalia who operates the flight."" I called Alitalia. ""Nope. We can't do it because you booked through Air France."" !!!! Called Air France and asked for supervisor. She called Alitalia. Same answer. It's a ""code share"" flight so no way can I get seats! Amazingly, she told me if I had booked the Alitalia flight with either Delta or KLM (the same flight operated by Alitalia) then I COULD have booked my seats! Nothing on the site indicated that. I've wasted about an hour and a half on the phone in this Kafka-esque universe."|air-france
101|"I cannot give more than 1 star. Although the flight was timely and the quality of in-flight service and entertainment, etc., was all fine, the seats are so tiny that the 8-hour flight from Atlanta to Paris was incredibly uncomfortable. Everyone around me was remarking on how incredibly narrow the seats were. I am an average size and height woman, and I even had booked a bulkhead window seat; however, I was massively uncomfortable the entire time, unable to sleep at all on this overnight flight, and arrived at my overseas destination completely exhausted and sore all over. This was a ""wide-ride"" plane with 2 aisles and 3 rows across of seats, which apparently had been refitted to make room for more seats in a 3/4/3 configuration. Will NEVER fly with them again."|air-france
102|"Very bad customer service.
My daughter took a flight with her mom on Dec 25, 2016 with Air France from LAX to Paris. As they had separated seats she paid $70 for roomier seats side by side with one seat by the alley.. When taking off the stewardess coudn't deliver 2 seats but not by the alley. My daughter claimed and the stewardess promised to credit back thze amount paid by register a file number in the air france website.
On Jan 5 as we have no news from Air France I called Air France USA using the number they indicated in the email they sent to my daughter. They then did not recognize the claim file number and suggest me to call Air France in France. so did I but the answer is the same. people in Air France customer care service do not care about your problem. They just keep saying they can;t help. I losse 1.30 hour for nothing.
This company is an example of a French steted owned company. Avoid them.

103|Delays happen. Flights get cancelled. Luggage gets misplaced. BUT reputable companies have quality customer service. Not Air France. My colleagues and I had a connecting Air France flight through Paris Aéroport - Charles de Gaulle (CDG) to Prague Airport - Letiště Praha. Luggage didn't arrive and we were told it would arrive at Hilton Honors in Prague within 24 hours. Long story short, it's not on its way for two days and we're stranded without our luggage and missing critical business meetings as a result. Insult to injury, after 90 minutes of calls pleading for help Air France customer service dismissed our conerns, claimed they were not able to help and at one point one yelled at my colleague. SO frustrating. Never again. #dontflyairfrance|air-france

When I told them I had a very short connection and my seat was all the way back they promptly offer to me to check and for my surprise they put me in one the front seats and no charge for the seats . This happened few times and I am appreciated this gestures .

Last month my husband and I flew on another airline to Cancun and they kept seats open in between strangers due to Covid. Also When I got to me seat after boarding there were crumbs in my seat. Obviously not cleaning well.|american-airlines
107|"I called AA at 11:04 am to book a round trip flight from Cleveland to Miami Jan 9-12. Talked to a agent by the name Mohammed.  The flight left Cleveland 6am. Flight round trip was $92 or $97. Mohammed worked out the details on me using my miles. After talking with him for 15 mins he stated that if I would like to call back within 24 hours to book said flight that I could. He has it reserved for me. I call backed 30 mins later and another agent said no record of the call and reservation. Also the price was not the same anymore. If I had known the price would not have stayed the same I would have booked it right there and then. I then called and talked to customer service about this and they stated there was no record of me calling AA at all. I said this was was 3 rd call. She then said I was mistaken and must have called another airlines. During my 2nd phone call with AA I booked the same flight for Sunday that I was to fly Saturday. I then told the lady on the 3rd phone call that she was wrong I had called 3 times today amd gave her my booking number. She got quiet because your computers were wrong. I have hotel and car booked for Saturday that I will need to change if I fly out Sunday. 3rd call I talked to a supervisor that said I was wrong and that those fairs were never for Saturday when 3 people here and Mohammed saw them.
Hope you can makes this right.

The name supposed to represent much more Loretta change the name that's not American Standard"|american-airlines
109|"Totally Disappointed! the initial flight was delayed for over an hour. I told the flight attendants that I had 2 connecting flights, so I asked them if I could make it to the next connecting flight.

The flight attendant told me that the flight was going to be late and told me to RUN to the next gate. They didn't even help me to get out of the flight first so I could catch the next flight. It's not how you handle the business; they should at least train the crew basic customer service.

And American Airlines refused to pay for my hotel even though I bought the insurance through AA. Fly with Delta or Southwest!"|american-airlines
110|"Extremely rude guy in customer service and put me on hold several times for  a long time.  This is why I don't fly American ... most of the time I call in to customer service, the agents are extremely rude and arrogant.

I had called to use credits towards for travel in April 2021 and was using credits from flight cancelled in March 2020 due to covid (when all flights were cancelled).  The guy said he booked my flight but when I went online, no reservation showed up.  I had to call back and surprisingly I got a nice lady in customer service who indicated that the flight was on hold however was not booked or ticketed.  She fixed the issue, apologized and gave me the confirmation number."|american-airlines

I had a ticket and was not able to travel due to COVID. I was moving and ended up driving. I called to refund and was even willing to transfer to someone else since I couldn't use it and I was told I had to travel by 12 2021 or I would lose my money nothing they could or would do. If it were my fault I'd understand but we were all told not to travel by plane it due to covid if possible so I take the advice and. Now I. Out 300. Definitely not caring about customers. I called and emailed over and over now almost a year later still no response until I called again today and they aren't willing to help in any way literally said I have to.make a trip or lose my money."|american-airlines
112|"First of all, let me say how shocked I am at my experience flying with American Airlines! Never did I expect the level of customer service or comfort that I received. I flew out of LAX (Los Angeles) headed to Kailua, Hawaii. It was very easy and calm boarding the flight. Like most people, you pray that your row is empty and it's just you. Thankfully, my wish came true and I was the only one on my row AND I had the coveted window seat!

I looked around the cabin and was really surprised at how many empty seats there were, but hey...who's complaining?! Certainly not me!  The flight attendants were fabulous! They even got on the intercom and advised everyone that if they wanted to stretch out and move onto an empty row, they could. Everyone cheered! People moved around and got comfortable and off we went.

The flight attendants gave us extra snacks, were very attentive and even chatted with us. The flight was smooth and very comfortable. I put my feet up and tuned in to one of the many great movies they have to offer. The screens are on the back of each chair and they hand out free earplugs, whereas other airlines want to charge you for them. Watching movies definitely helped the time pass and you're also able to see what altitude you're flying at, as well as the outside temperature.

All in all, it was a great flight and I was very satisfied with everything. I'd be happy to fly with American, again!"|american-airlines
113|"There's nothing more American than ripping people off for baggage fees and what not, and on the few unfortunate times I've used American, that's what they tried to do.

I always had a better luck flying out of LAX with Southwest than I did American. It was the same story in San Diego. American just seemed more anal (not in a good way), less friendly, and sometimes more expensive - and always more penny-pinching. They still do.

Definitely not one of my favorite Airlines."|american-airlines
114|I did it, I did it, flew td trip lax to Miami for a wonderful week of vacation on the cheap because so many people believed all the fearmongering from the fakenewsmedia. Let me tell you it's 200% safe, the airlines have hepa filters better grade than the hospitals. Most middle seats were empty. I had a few bad experience w AA but this flight was so wonderful, The Boeing 700-300 was the best plane on earth  I caught Black Friday sale $195 pp other airlines still charged $450 so support AA before they all go bankrupt, lucky me I flew out a few hours before Gruesome locks us up again.|american-airlines
115|"Had a flight on Feb 3 2021 from LAX to HNL (AA31) and the stewardesses are telling everyone to wear a mask properly throughout the flight and we are all abiding. Three hours into the flight, one of the stewardesses is in the back of the plane having a loud  and clear conversation, clearly not wearing a mask. I asked one of the other stewardesses if masks were optional on this flight and the woman told me that it was extremely illegal to not wear a mask on a flight- ""it's federal law!"". I asked what the deal was with her coworker and she said she's asked her to put on her mask twice.  If any passenger acted the way this stewardess acted, we'd be getting escorted off the plane in cuffs. American Airlines needs to handle this."|american-airlines
116|"Flight delayed due to weather causing me to arrive at my connecting flight exactly at departure time. The plane was still at the gate. I was refused boarding and told my seat was given away to a standby customer. Can you believe this? They knew the flight was delayed, they knew when we landed and that we all rushed to get there only to be told basically too bad. Now I'm waiting over 6 hours for next flight,
There was a time when the gate agents would phone ahead to tell them we were on our way, but no longer, no one cares, we are on our own and if there is a problem no matter who caused it, it up to us to figure it out. And I had a first class ticket. From this day forward I will avoid American to the point I will change my plans just to take another airline, I will no longer accumulate miles and I will tell my story to anyone who will listen. American Airlines is DEAD to me"|american-airlines
117|"Guess the new communist attitude in America is spreading like wildfire... My boyfriend & I were just kicked off of a flight because the over zealous flight attendant thought we had an attitude with her! No one raised their voice, no one was aggressive or derogatory yet they delayed the flight to have security remove us! Unbelievable, we are sitting in the airport selling off all of our AA stock right now!!!!!

In addition, I am considered a high risk for COVID and received a letter from my doctor which I provided to American Airlines but they refused to refund me the ticket price. I could really use the funds to apply to my medical bills which have started to mount but unfortunately consumers don't seem to have any rights during this pandemic.  Be aware and be wary of American Airlines!!!|american-airlines
120|After being told that the flights are thoroughly sanitize between flights, I was very disappointed to find that the surfaces and seats were extremely dirty after I wiped them down with a sanitizing wipe (see picture). I felt very uncomfortable with this flight due to this and the fact that the entire plane was packed to full capacity during a pandemic.|american-airlines

Can somebody do something??

If I had the choice, I will never flight with them.

Not at the airport, not at the gate, not boarding the plane. This is CRIMINALLY NEGLIGENT BEHAVIOR. I urge ALL passengers who contract Covid after an AA flight to join me in a Class Action Suit to put these Criminals out of business ASAP.
When you tell the AA staff that I have a Dangerous Underlying Condition (Heart problems and out of control cholesterol) and they even refuse to let me PAY to upgrade my seat to PROTECT MY HEALTH, they are putting their stock price in priority over the Deaths of their customers.

127|"DO NOT FLY WITH THEM --- LIFE THREATENING!

We did not even leave the gate and it was a complete sh$@-show.

AA changed our flights from direct to different layover flight, so that we can have ""social distance"" as the direct flight was too packed.

Zero social distances on new itinerary, and plane was packed to the gills.

Then a mechanical issue with NO AIR IN CABIN--TEMPS IN CABIN REACHING 94-95 DEGREES ( face mask on ). 100% Banana Republic conditions.

The most interesting point here is that we are in a pandemic and LA is currently on a upswing yet AA has zero regards for passengers.  With the sweltering heat in the cabin at 94 degrees people removing masks, fanning themselves,.... it's ridiculous!  100% germ and virus incubator!  

Don't let this happen to you..."|american-airlines
128|It started with connecting flights from Wisconsin to Florida.  No direct flights.  Making us board 4 planes on our trip.  Speaking of boarding, each time we boarded, we had to walk past people already on the plane.  Instead of making it a safe flight by boarding from the rear forward, they risked our lives each time by making us walk past people.  Those who are already seated also were at risk.  No way to social distance with this type of unhealthy boarding.  For an airline during a pandemic, AA can care less about your health.  I could go on about our transferring flights, but it just goes down hill from here.|american-airlines

Everyone is shoulder to shoulder like pre Covid and now we are all going to take our masks off to have a beverage.  Gov Cuomo would be screaming super spreader.  I can't have 10 people in my home or ask another family over for dinner, restaurants have to do outside seating and 25% capacity inside. Children can't sit on Santa's lap and can only see him 10 feet away behind glass like an animal in a cage and we can not see the tree in Rockefeller light up but American Airlines can pack you in like sardines.

132|"I took a flight Sept 20th & returned the 24th 2020.
AA writes how safe they are during the virus. We thought we would take a trip because they convinced us they have set up a safe environment . A complete & total lie. The planes were over booked. They were packed. People were all over each other & nothing is set up for de-boarding or distancing while getting off the plane. People were on top of each other & no American airline person even tried to have people leave the plane in an orderly manner. Isles were jammed while waiting for the door to open. Even if you are waiting your turn in your seat people are all around on top of you.
Can't even begin to know how much contact... touching contact happened. Don't do it. They do not care about anyone's safety. They let the plane land while a girl was in the bathroom. I am blown away how little is being done by American Airlines to keep anyone safe in any way shape or form. It's crazy dangerous. I woke with a runny nose this morning & I kept my mask on & used hand sanitizer.  Use a responsible airline while this virus is running wild. I worry about my friend who is a flight attendant & AA practice of overbooking during this time. What is wrong with this company!"|american-airlines
133|"Almost could have given them a good rating until the last flight of our trip. Flight #1751 from Miami to Cleveland, Ohio 1/11/21.  Mask policy was not enforced. A family of four was allowed on this flight sneezing, coughing, and continuously short of breath.  The father had his mask down the entire flight.  Even with the flight attendants walking by and picking up trash.  After the flight was over I informed the flight attendants that they did not enforce the mask policy as defined by the state, cdc, and every department of health.  The attendants reply was ""I made several announcements over head.  Didn't you hear?"".   This is a failure in compliance with the continuing pandemics guidelines at the Federal, State, and local level.  American Airlines is endangering their customers."|american-airlines
134|I will not be flying American Airlines again in the future. In light of the pandemic, we had decided to postpone our family vacation and are now in the process of rebooking for later in 2021. I had previously booked 6 passengers, and had a flight credit of $230 per ticket. Initially, I had attempted to re-book on their sight as suggested - this was a disaster. Not only would it not allow me to book the flight for the child passenger, it was impossible to get everyone on one flight. Despite having about $100 in trip credit, the transaction (via telephone) ended up costing $9 as each ticket costed more than the last. I was also not able to use the credit for baggage. This seems completely unfair to me, especially in light of the current conditions of air travel. Will absolutely not book with AA again.|american-airlines
135|"I don't even know where to begin on this review, honestly. Horrible communication. Horrible planning. Multiple delays. I understand things happen. Delays happen. But the communication with the airport and the airline itself was awful. We had 4 flight time changes WITHIN 5 MINUTES. WHAT THE WHAT. And this was an all day thing. Everytime our delay would miss our connecting flight, we'd reschedule only to have to come back hours later and have to fix our connecting flight again.
At this rate we should've been refunded. Will never fly American again. Get your shit together."|american-airlines
136|This airline has sub-par flight attendants with attitudes. This airline also had over filled the fuel tanks so we had to sit on the runway and burn off fuel for over 1 hour before we could take off.

I will never fly American again!|american-airlines

I do have to say that I had a really nice flight to Boston in a big gigantic plane with a movie screen.  Plug in you noise cancelling headphones and enjoy a couple of movies, some tunes, and poof, after 5.5 hours, you're at your destination.

When I went inside there was feces all over the toilet seat and toilet in the bathroom.
Unacceptable!
This means the bathroom was NOT clean before passengers entering like they advertised.

Well, we are 1 hour 10 minutes late and counting to take off after boarding because we can't get the toilet unplugged. Note to self, always be sure to book same flight as a reputable plumber. And of course I am mid 50s on my first flight.

Also, I  paid like $17 dollars extra to set by the window, 1st flight you know, while waiting in line to board an unusual lady impatiently cuts in front of my wife and I, my wife turns to me and asks ""where do you bet she'll be sitting?"", at this point I will remind you to never go to the casino with me so yes right beside us in my seat. She did seem like a very nice lady though with some personal situation.

While waiting to board my wife drank large tea, luckily I passed, now she needs to go very badly, so much she begs the plane staff to let her off, they have refused so far. Remember when the attorneys had to get a court order to force the airline to let them unboard after holding them 4 hours? Hope we national coverage too.

She asked the pilot this time, he told her don't flush,

Hold on, might be going now, pilot says toilet might work if we get high. Well still sitting here guessing pilot doesn't get to make the big decisions only fly a 30 million dollar aircraft over billions of families with 250 plus souls depending on his unyielding awareness to every possible negative senerio relating to safely operate a plane without a bathroom.

Flight attendants didn't ask passengers to wear their mask correctly, even after walking down the isle several times to take trash and ask passengers to put their tables up. Their effective policy is to look the other way when confronted with obvious mask policy violations. I asked them to enforce the policy with passengers around me, but passengers soon after removed their mask again without repercussions. No follow-ups were made.  (I also directly asked the passengers behind me to wear their masks to which I was told ""the virus isn't real"")

Flying with American Airlines was not as safe as advertised during these flights and I will not be flying with AA if at all possible in the future.

In this situation I was told that I did not Pre-register my dog prior to my flight.. two points for this. -- on the American Airlines website itself it reports that emotional support dogs need a 48 hour notice before their flights and that service dogs themselves do not need Pre-registration ( fine and dandy) -- despite not needing to register my service dog I still called American one week prior to my flight and let SEC know I would be flying with her and I was told everything was in order.

Well let's keep going.. while standing in front of my gate the staff was extremely rude to me and told me they were going to close the gate on me since my dog was not in the system (again, not necessary since she is a service dog and not an emotional support dog). I attempted to call customer service and I was blatantly told they did not want to take the call. Can you believe that?

They closed the gate on me and didn't even offer to try to reschedule my flight for a later time or try to accommodate anything for something that was very clearly not my fault.

I ended up having to drive 4 hours in a rental car in order to make it to the urgent care where I work. I worked my 8 hour shift, saw my 50 patients and wrote an email to customer service explaining my situation and how disrespectfully I was treated during the entire situation.

The following day I received a phone call from an agent. She apologized and proceeded to tell me that it was basically my fault since my dog does not qualify as a service dog and that I did not call in advance ( when I did and my call log proves it). Also, my dog 100% qualifies as a service dog and it can be proved with paperwork ( however, it is my right to confidentiality and specifics are not required). I expressed to them what service my dog provides me and that is all they are allowed to ask of me legally. Yet despite this information she continued to tell me my dog did not qualify as a service god and that someone would contact me to ask further questions.

Well that was 11 days ago and I have yet to hear from anyone since then. I wrote another email to customer service and again have yet to hear from them.

Bottom line: I was disgusted by the way I was treated that day despite me doing everything correctly and speaking to all of them with the respect any human being deserves (regardless of how they treated me).

Not only is American Airlines not keeping their word on social distancing ( no skipped seats and still filling the plane front to back) but they are also terrible at customer service, rude to their loyal clients (I've been using them for many years), and ruthless when it comes to extending a helping hand particularly in these times of need."|american-airlines
151|"Worst check in experience ever!!! Now I remember why I don't fly American and out of LAX... Grace Tsang and her manager Precious were very antsy and on edge... Grace decide today was the day to leave her prescription glasses at home. Therefore, misreading everything and putting more pressure on me, the customer, as I was already feeling it from them due to my bag being overweight. So embarrassing having to open up all your belongs just to please the check in agents. I have already paid for two bags. We are in a time where we should united and so compassion. I did not feel any sincerity from any of the AA agents and TSA. Companies this big only promote it in their advertising. But they don't really mean it. Let alone care. All of them gave the vibe like they didn't want to be there. Then don't be. Quit your job. Simple. I will not be flying back through here. I will be changing my return flight. Byeeee American

I purchased seating arrangements and they never updated my seats so during a pandemic my fiance and get stuck with 2 middle seats in between complete strangers.

They obviously are struggling and have no idea how to run their business. Truly sad to see."|american-airlines

He attempted to contact American Airlines, and was essentially told he could only leave a 'lost items' report. If someone were to locate the item, they could check the 'lost items' system and respond.

NOBODY, and I mean NOBODY, was willing to contact the flight crew to conduct a real-time search. Not a single person even attempted to assist him. After a month, they closed out his request despite multiple phone calls/attempts to contact."|american-airlines

158|"This was my first time flying with American Airlines. We departed to Mexico and I have to admit that the flight there was good. The interior was clean and all the passengers were distanced from each other.

Our flight back from Mexico was supposed to be nonstop from puerto Vallarta to lax. We got a notification 4 days before the flight telling us that we now had a layover in Arizona due to a ""Scheduled flight change."" This change caused us to lose at least 3 hours from our day.

After two hours of arguing on the phone on why the layover occurred we found out that the airline did not have as much people as it wanted in one a
flight . We attempted to refund the flight back to use the money to take a nonstop flight but they could only offer credit.

We stuck with the lay over and it was one of the most crammed flights I have ever been in.

This was the point that really pissed a lot of people off.  In all my years of flying I have not seen such a rude flight attendant. An elderly couple was seated a few rows down from us. 15 minutes before landing the man asked for water for his wife. The flight attendant who looked like she should be retired by now literally screamed at him telling him they were about to land. It was so awkward and rude to the point where several people began turning their heads to look at the flight attendant. Once she realized that several people were now staring at her getting ready to tell her off, she showed up with 3 cups of water for the elderly couple.

Never again will I do any business with American Airlines."|american-airlines
159|"Dear American Airlines
American Airlines flight from Charlotte NC to MKE flight 5422 8 pm July 31, 2020. I was not able to sit in the seat without having a very large person touching me. This person should have been made to buy two seats.  I took a photo but I am afraid it does not accurately show the man's size ( he was 350 pounds plus) - to give you an idea: he had to lean into the aisle the whole flight so as not to smother me. The center arm rest could not even be lowered.

The gate people changed my seat assignment Just before the flight. I booked a seat on a very large plane, your company made the decision to change the plane to a CRJ900A (a small plane two across) . I imagine the goal was to pack the airplane during this pandemic.

Before the flight - the crew made an announcement that, If anyone would like to change their seat assignment because of social distancing push the call button and the attendant will find you another seat. So when I pushed by button the flight attendant  Brabara  came. I asked to change seats  because distancing was impossible and she said all seats are taken. I said they made an announcement about social distancing and I need to change seats. To that she said ""Oh they have to say that, there are no available seats."" I said but, they just said it now? She had A very curt manner and said there is nothing Left except my jump Seat.  The she turned off my call button and retreated.

Jamming people together and then making an announcement about being Concerned for passenger safety is apparently all lies.
After the flight I waited for everyone to exit the plane, and then I asked the flight attendant her name. She just stared at me. I again asked for her name. She said, ""It was a short flight"". I asked, are you going to tell me your name? And she finally said Barbara. I sent AA this letter, and I will summarize their response...

Summary of the American Airlines response to my complaint: some people are big and we are sorry about that. And we are also sorry you were uncomfortable. We will put it in the database. Please fly with us again.
lol Not a word about their misleading announcement during the pandemic."|american-airlines
160|The plane arrived at the destination to unsafe conditions and had to turn around and land back at the origin airport. Unfortunately for many guests, no extra care, credit hotel voucher, lounge access, or even a bag of pretzels was offered to weary travelers who learned they would be stranded in Los Angeles for the night. I met people from 18 - 80 who desperately tried to sleep in a crowded airport after American Airlines abandoned them. It was a shame on the company and solidified my reasons for ending American Airlines purchases for frequent business and personal travel.|american-airlines

And to top it off I paid to upgrade to sit in main cabin instead of economy to only, really, sit in what looks like economy!! This is not acceptable. I have never been this upset.  It's too late for me cuz my entire family and I are already on board. But save yourself, ur family and ur money. I will be filing a HUGE compliant.|american-airlines

The cabin smelled like dirty sweaty armpit. And for a 5 hour flight we didn't even get a bag of peanuts, I'm sure they can afford at least that. Last time I fly w/American Airlines.|american-airlines
163|"AA doesn't deserve one star actually, but there's is no way to give zero stars. First of all, how the heck you have confirmed seats but you can't get on the plane? The AA representative's answer was: the seats were taken by people who are on the waiting list. Are you kidding me? This is extra ordinary bs. Second thing,  the obnoxious behavior and the bad attitude of the front desk person, she didn't even apologize for what they did. She should get fired. Never again AA, this isn't the right way to do business. I wouldn't be surprised if AA go out of business, I'll hold beer to that.

Therefore, she got a non stop flight on jet blue . American also fills the entire cabin , JetBlue does not fill the middle seat . I flew American last week and it was delayed 3 times . The plane was dirty , food and beverages were not provided and the kids in the plane were not wearing a mask . The flight attendant didn't even check .
This is totally inappropriate during Covid .
I will no longer fly with American ."|american-airlines
166|During this Covid pandemic, safety should be everyone's top priority, ESPECIALLY airlines. Unfortunately, I had no choice but to fly a couple days ago. On my flight, there was NEITHER social distancing NOR mask enforcement. I had the fortune of having someone sit directly next to me, and she was NOT wearing her mask properly or consistently, even AFTER I had politely asked her to do so. Although announcements were made on the overhead that masks would be enforced for the duration of the flight, this was not the case at all. For the safety of ALL passengers and staff, American and their staff need to do a much better job, because this is EXACTLY how Covid spreads. I expect and demand more from them. I will be advising my friends and family to steer clear of flying with American moving forward. You should do the same.|american-airlines

He arrived an hour before his flight and they told him he had missed his bag check in time (who knew that was even a thing) and stated he had to go on standby.  However,  now he will miss his connection flight back to his deployment base because he is on a standby flight an hour later than his original flight. This is absolutely ridiculous!  He didn't miss his plane, just a bag check in. This is not how you treat customers or members of our military. Never will we fly AA again!|american-airlines

My seat was next to a passenger not wearing a mask through out the flight out. Nor did the flight attendants ask to have person to wear mask. That is irresponsible for as a big company to allow.

After dealing with customer service for two hours now having to stay overnight somewhere costing me more money with no offers. Flying first class and find out they are sending me somewhere that the lounge is closed when there were options to go other places. Clearly they are trying to push people through with no consideration of what they are doing or the money you spent on getting somewhere. Never will fly this airline again.

It makes me wonder how long our suitcases were left outside in the rain.  The 2nd leg of our flight was canceled, so we had to (attempt to) sleep in the airport overnight.  It makes me wonder if our suitcases were left outside...  Oh, and when I asked a question (a few times) because I've never experienceda canceled flight, I got so many IdK responses, but never did any of the employees seek out an answer.  Matter-of-fact, one employee (at DFW) told was the rudest employee (from ANY company I've ever encountered) tried to ignore me all together when I was saying, ""Excuse me"" to get his attention.  After about the 3rd ""excuse me"", he stopped (as he was literally tryingto ignore me and walk away).  He told me that he couldn't help me because I was not on his ATL flight.  I just needed to know where the customer service counter was.  (His co-worker witnessed his awful behavior and told me where it was.)  I am completely appalled by his response and will try to avoid American Airlines in the future.  Never in my 45 years of living have I ever experienced the outright rudeness of that employee!!!!

182|"American Airlines your have exceeded the expectations of lousy guest service. On October 18, I booked a round trip ticket to DFW. The price was $366.01. I had a credit due to a canceled flight you could not get crew for earlier this year. So I called your reservations line to handle the credit, since you can't inconveniently do it on line. So after all your fee's I was able to use $100 of the credit. You sent me my confirmation for my round trip. You sent it to my American App. You charged me for upgraded seats on the going and return flight.

Today, I get to the airport and have to see an agent. The agent tells me I only have a return ticket and I can purchase a ticket today for $400. I show the agent all the receipts and confirmations to only hear, you have to call reservations because he and the American Help Desk can't help.

Now mind you, I am now missing a sales call. So I call reservations and am told, when I called to use the credit, the agent only booked a one way ticket at full price, so I will need to pay $400 for a one way today, but she is using the price from October 18th. I tell her the round trip was only $366, and she replies but we now have to book one way. So I say, you are telling me, I reserved a round trip ticket. You charged me for a round trip ticket. You sent me the receipt and confirmation for the round trip ticket and updated the round trip ticket on my app. But because your agent checked the wrong box, I have to purchase a $400 ticket? Her reply, that's correct. Plus, no refund on upgraded seats. Guess why, because they gave my seat to a flight attendant who has yet to put her mask on: masks do t work around your ear.

There is no social distancing on the plane as well as loading and unloading passengers. Also planes are packed and no seating in between passengers at all!!

Could have easily taken temperature checks but nope no precautions whatsoever!! passengers were seated right next to each other even when we could t get seats for our family together the flight wasn't even full yet people were crammed next to each other.  There was no loading g and unloading of passengers in a safe manner when it could have been so easy to load and unload in small groups safely.  No drinks which is understandable but at least hand out hand wipes. Just a terrible experience.

We sat in the hot plane (in Dallas) for over two hours just for them to tell us that we had to deplane and get a new one. Mind you by the time we deplane, everything in the airport is closed and we are the only people in there. This time it's a battery, they don't have extra ones so they have to charge it or maybe they are waiting to have one driven here? I'm not sure because we've been given 5 different explanations and 5 different flight times. I would've been home at 6 but now I won't be home until at least 10 pm. If you are not properly taking care of the planes or having all spare parts on hand, why are you flying them?
Also there is no social distancing in the airplane which ultimately defeats the purpose of wearing masks. The person next to me can take their mask off to eat, if they had covid I would surely get it too. Thanks American Airlines. I will be sure to never use you again."|american-airlines

This was already a rebook, we had flights with Alaska for April and when the pandemic happened they refunded us our unrefundable tickets with no questions asked.
We naively thought American would do the same. Well they refused to give us our money back, so we disputed with our credit card company, who were told since we voluntarily canceled our flights we arent entitled to a refund. So not only are we out over $1,600 but our flight credit with American was deactivated so we are left with nothing but a $1,600 debt. When we tried sorting this out we spoke with Dawn, a manager in reservations department, and she was extremely unprofessional and accusatory.

197|"If you are a surfer DO NOT TAKE THIS AIRLINE! Here is why:

  I took a surf trip and at the airport of arrival, was told our surf boards were sent to another island, and will be arriving later that night. I picked up my boards later that night and noticed all of my boards were damaged to the point I could not use them on my trip.

 I called up the airline to explain the damage they had done to my boards. They specifically told me to go rent surfboards since mine were damaged, and that they would take full responsibility for the cost of rentals and repairs.
 
 Upon returning home from the surf trip, I took my boards to a repair shop, as I was instructed to per american airlines. I sent them over all of the receipts and information they requested. They approved the reimbursement for the rentals, but they claimed they needed to verify the receipt from the repair shop. Ok, no problem. 2 weeks go by, now they send me another e-mail stating they will not reimburse me for the rentals because it was an interim expense incurred to delayed baggage, and their policy does not cover interim expenses incurred to delayed baggage for employees and their guests.
1st off, my property was DAMAGED, not delayed.
2nd reason why this struck a cord with me, if this is your policy, why did your airline instruct me to rent boards and be reimbursed in the first place?
3rd if this is how they treat their employees and their guests, they aren't going to treat customers any better.

 I ended up e-mailing the person handling the case multiple times, and he won't respond to me. I requested to have a supervisor call me and they threatened me over the phone and hung up on me. Then they sent me another e-mail stating that they aren't going to honor the repair receipt I provided because it had the wrong date, which it didn't, they just can't tell the difference between a hand written 0 and a 8.

  To summarize my review, American Airlines damaged my boards. They instructed me to rent boards and fix mine for a reimbursement. They then used every excuse in the book as to why they were not going to reimburse me. They just lost a customer and a whole lot more for life. All they had to do was take responsibility for damages they did."|american-airlines

No doubt Mr James flies Southwest or United just to avoid the traffic. Haha. But seriously, LAX does absolutely nothing to improve it - not that they really can. LAX was designed at a different point in time where these problems weren't foreseen. The only, real, solution is to completely rebuild LAX on the south side of the airport. Maybe in so doing, American Airlines and their terminal might actually be modern and have useful amenities. Heck, just relocate the bulk of traffic to T5.

This is long enough without going full on ""old man rant"".  Step up your game, AA. Reclaim your crown. Put Southwest and JetBlue to shame! As Rob Schneider said in The Water Boy, ""you can do eeeet!"""|american-airlines
202|"Such and ""average"" customer experience. For the money that was spent re-doing the restaurant space, you could have, oh, I don't know... Put in something decent?
So, you've got the really second-rate Homeboy Cafe, a pizza BAR, some French-themed thing in a desperate attempt to add some class, another BAR, and something undoubtedly second-rate ""coming soon"".

The waiting areas are dumps. The seating arrangement in the lounge/waiting areas are awful (what is it with the goofy, angled seats anyway?)

American just needs to demo the entire terminal and start over.

Lastly, American Airlines themselves. My, how the once mighty have fallen. We are no longer clients. No longer valued customers. Just a bunch of money-paying cattle to herd into your planes. By and large, your attendants look like they'd rather be elsewhere; you nickel and dime us for every little thing under the sun; you penalize us for having the temerity to have a change in plans; if you're not elite, you charge those goofy baggage fees... The list goes on and on...

It's really sad. You used to be so good!!!"|american-airlines

204|"Just found out today that AA changed my son's flights to terrible times/connections.  And then said they won't charge me any extra money.  Wow, thanks.  When I called to switch to better flights, now my son can't have a window seat unless I pay extra because they only have ""upgraded seats"" left.  He had a window seat on the originally booked flight.  Pretty bad when they change the flight and you can't get the same things you paid for initially.  And they charge for bags.  We just had had flights last month with Southwest and they were super accommodating, even when they changed our flights due to COVID restrictions.  Their bags are free and the flight is cheaper.  So I'd fly Southwest instead."|american-airlines
205|Worst airline ever. They told me I can change my return flight home anytime for the value that it costed. Now while trying to change it they are offering me $11 for a $150 ticket and saying to change it to the other flight would be an additional $140. Keep in mind my ticket I am trying to change it to is only valued at $80 so I should have more than enough and then some to change this flight. They are a leech of a company and only want to keep your money in their bank account so they can gain the interest it gives them. That's why they deny cash refunds just to make more money off you.

I can't believe how bad this airline is. Avoid it in all cost!! They will still your money! Holding you to policies that don't make any sense. Virgin America and south west are 20x better! Trust me I fly close to 40 flights a year and know what I am talking about. The reps are a joke, incompetent, and misleading. They blamed a charge issue on Expedia, had me fighting it for hours just to find out it was really up to American Airlines to take care of it and they eventually told me, after an hour over the phone, that it was non refundable bc if I canceled the charge would be more then the cost of the ticket. DELTA IS BETTER! and delta sucks!

209|"One of the worst travel experiences in 45 years:
1- Atrocious customer service from start to finish.
2- Inept, rude, and unresponsive management that avoids responsibility for poor service, which is mirrored by unsupported front line personnel, translating to a company that simply doesn't care.
3- Delays of more than 4 hours for a 2 hour flight with no weather/disaster excuse... is inexcusable. Management knew, yet kept everyone (50 people ages 4 months-84 years) waiting with consecutive delays totaling 4 hours before cancelling flight....at 1 AM in the morning, leaving us stranded in the middle of the night with very limited rebook options within the next 12 hours.

I could have driven faster and for less expense (even in a rental).

I worked front lines, managed, and trained others in customer service and logistics for decades. Had I treated customers as poorly as we were treated, I would have been fired.

Transportation is a service, and we have many choices. I will never fly American Airlines again.

211|Flew them a week and half ago from San Diego to New Hampshire with mutiple stops. I think its funny how at most airports they leave a few seats blocked off in the terminals so people don't sit next to each other because of covid, but its ok once we leave the terminal for us to have the flight packed to the brim with everyone sitting next to each other. Guess covid isn't a thing on American Airlines. Actually I take that back because they must think its a real issue because they offer no food or drink services.|american-airlines

216|This was an airline that would swear by when I was 32 years old. I wouldn't dare take a flight with anyone else.  Well I'm assuming that over the years, things have drastically changed. As of 2019 (now I'm 39 years old) American airlines, to me has became the worst. In short my husband and I flew to belize in the beginning of 2019. We arrived at out gate only to find out that our gates had been switched. Not only did they overbook our non-stop flight but at 11pm at night they asked if anyone was willing to give up their seat for a $650 round trip voucher and also one night stay in a hotel with meal voucher included. They made this offer sound real good, so my husband went for it. Well, turns out the hotel was too far away from the airport to get a good night's rest and to enjoy a meal. The next flight that was available and traveling to our destination was at 5am in the morning and it wasn't a non-stop flight but stopped in Dallas Texas. So we was stuck with no food and nowhere to rest our heads till 5am. After arriving in Belize the next day we got off the plane only to find out that our luggage was misplaced. They couldn't find our luggage, so we went four days with no change of clothes!! That happen in 2019. My husband and I decided to use the vouchers that were issued to us in 2019 for another trip to Belize this year. Again we arrived at out gate only to find out that our gates had been switched. That have me a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. We changed gates there was nowhere to sit while waiting for our flight. We were forced to on the floor. Then when we arrived in Miami and changed planes we literally had to hold our carry on bags, which wasn't easy, seeing that my husband's carry on was like miniature luggage. To make matters worse one of the passengers on board who sat in front of me decided he wanted to get extra comfortable. He pushes his seat all the way back, which left me with very little room to maneuver. Mind you this was a three hour flight. IM SO DONE WITH AMERICAN AIRLINES!!!! I CAN'T STAND THEM ANYMORE!!!|american-airlines
217|Nasty terminal personnel,   They are happy to call you sweetie.  No beverage service like all other airlines.  Show up with 3 small bags and they will check one.  Flying old and uncomfortable airbuses.   Sets are too close, too small and too narrow.  No COVID distancing.|american-airlines
218|"I am appalled at how American Airlines staff knowingly allowed this woman to continually be subjected to this behavior. This mans behavior is ABUSE. I can not imagine how frightened she must have been. She will undoubtedly have PTSD the rest of her life. I will never fly with American Airlines again.

219|"While I was waiting for our plane to depart flying from Dallas to San Diego I remember hearing the flight attendant through the speakers thanking us for flying American and how the airline is doing everything they can to protect us during these times... I felt a chill run through me as I watched a plane full of terrified passengers. Such a surreal image, I felt mocked and ridiculed by American Airlines. This is what I experienced:

1. Seating- We were a group of 3 traveling together but our seats were apart. When I approached the flight attendant at the gate (in Dallas on our way home to San Diego) to ask if they could move us and have us sit together (because you know, there is a pandemic going on and we wish to stay within ""our bubble""), he didn't even look at the screen to check he simply said: this is an full flight. WHAT? The announcement left me flabbergasted. A completely full flight during a pandemic? Didn't American reassure me they were doing everything they could? What happened to the promised social distancing measures on the aircraft to ensure OUR safety?  What happened to leaving empty seats to try to maintain distance? How come small businesses have to comply with this measure costing them greatly but one of the biggest corporations in the world can't be held accountable? So WHY is the company not implementing social distance guidelines? Furthermore, this employee didn't even try moving passengers around so we could sit together; not just for our safety but for the safety of others. Did not bother, did not care.

2. Boarding- all other major airlines I have flown with since this whole thing started have been boarding backwards starting from the end of the plane. This is to avoid people standing in the aisle while people are seated. But not American Airlines, no. As we sat, there were hundreds of passengers looming over us waiting for the line to move. INSANE.

3. Other concerns- Another thing I didn't see was the temperature check. I saw at least 1 very sick passenger, pale with visible sweats and barely able to stand or walk straight. I am not saying it was due to COVID but I had to certify that I didn't have any symptoms when flying so why was this person traveling with an illness? I would have expected any sick person to STAY AT HOME and for the company to implement that so passengers feel SAFE. Another thing that concerned me was that a lot of passengers were wearing their masks under their nose and the crew members allowed them to.

So when I received an email with a survey asking if I would recommend others to fly American Airlines the answer is simple: NO. Or at least NOT YET. Even though American Airlines have implemented many other excellent measures (requiring face masks during the duration of the flight as well as adding HEPA filters and electrostatic sprays inside the aircraft to kill germs and viruses), this is simply not enough to travel with the absolute confidence you promised us. Small locally owned businesses with less resources have stricter rules and more drastic measures than what I experienced during my flight. I will hold American Airlines (and any other major corporation) to the highest standards simply because WE SHOULD."|american-airlines
220|"I will never fly with them again, I never ever in my life was humiliated and treated like this by an airline employee, it's almost surreal. RAY NEILS at the checking counter made me feel like a piece of s...
as there was a glitch in their system when I upgraded to business class.

She did not even want to listen, she said I have to call whoever I bought my tickets from instead of trying to assist. I literally could not believe someone like her is actually working behind a check in counter. She did not even let me show her my online reservation she said whatever I have does not matter, she can't see the first leg of my trip in their system.

Then I called her supervisor who sorted it all out.
While the supervisor was assisting she was still making comments and when I told her I will definitely complain about her rude, arrogant behaviour, she said; YOU CAN TAKE MY NAME I ALREADY WROTE MY REPORT ABOUT THIS SO THEY KNOW WHST REALLY HAPPENED???????
I could not believe what I experienced here, I am still in shock, the whole situation was just surreal.

She even talked over her supervisor when he - very calmly and professionally- explained the glitch to
Me. She just could not stop!!!

222|This airline is outrageous!!! I am handicapped and went on a trip to see my brother at Fort Sam Houston. I contacted them before the day we left to tell them I'm handicapped. I apparently I'm supposed to get special seating which I did not receive and no ride to terminal they then asked me if I wanted a wheel chair to get to the plane from the gate. I already walked this far with my cane what's the point. They also said they have to take my cane and asked if I can walk without it. Why would I have a cane and also I have to wear a brace and asked if I could take both those off. Why would I have them if I don't need them. This was very embarrassing. If that wasn't enough my girlfriend was charge two bills of 31.93 for priority loading because of my handicap. I have bad nerve pain in my feet so I can't walk without shoes it's so painful but just because of what they did on the way there I decided it was so uncomfortable that I'd rather deal with the pain so I took them off. They did refund the two charges but they shouldn't be charging handicap people extra in the first place. Never flying with them again.|american-airlines

224|"I purchase 3 round trip tickets in Dec. of 2019 to attend my nephews wedding in March of 2020. I was supposed to fly out from Louisville, KY to LA. The day before we were supposed to leave, CA was shut down basically due to the Covid 19 virus outbreak and the wedding postponed indefinitely. I called to cancel my reservations and asked for a refund to which they replied sorry, that is not our policy. They proceeded to tell me that the Covid 19 Virus outbreak was not their fault and that I could use the tickets by Dec. 8th of 2020. I explained to them that the only reason I purchased the tickets was to attend the wedding which was not able to be rescheduled until sometime in 2021 and the date was not yet known. I asked them if they would extend the date of the tickets and they again said no, that it was against their policy.

Given the rare circumstances, they should have refunded my money or extended the date of the tickets and neither was done. I will NEVER fly American Airlines again unless it is a last resort. They should be refunding customers money; they need it to survive. If not, at the very least they should extend the expiration date of the tickets.

Even though there were 3 people flying business class, and two flying first class, the flight attendants were not the least bit attentive, choosing instead to lounge around in first class themselves and enjoy all the dinner trays lol

They didn't make any rounds of the cabin, didn't ask any questions about comfort, and when I ventured out to ask for some water, I was told ""ma'am pls stay behind the curtain in business class"".... are you serious?

The business class restroom was continually occupied by the staff, and they left it super dirty with paper towels strewn about and water everywhere

It was just a free flight for them, I guess they have gotten sued to the perks of empty flights due to covid and want to just enjoy instead of doing their job....sucks, I wouldn't fly AA again, such terrible and rude service.

My Fiancé had a First Class Ticket to fly from RDU to LAX on July 3, 2020. He was 2 minutes late and the gate was not closed, the agent would not  let him on the plane! The agent said ""This flight is booked"", my fiancé replied ""I have a boarding pass for First Class."" The agent walked down the corridor to the plane for 10 minutes leaving my fiancé at the gate then returned and shut the doors. The agent then books a flight for my fiancé from RDU to Charlotte, then tells him that the flights from Charlotte to LAX are full and he would have to ""Stand By."" BTW, this rebooked flight was for this morning July 4th and he had moved out of his apt yesterday to move to L.A.
American Airlines, this agent needs to be disciplined , this guy is a jerk.
So, AA obviously overbooked the flight and now we are stuck with a $600 credit, which we won't use because this is the worst Airline!!!

233|"I recently flew from LA to Chicago and back, and...well...both flights were okay. For both flights, we had gate changes, which were quite inconvenient.

For the LA to Chicago flight, not only were we transferred to a different gate, but also a different terminal. Thankfully, the terminal wasn't that far, but it was still quite a hassle. The takeoff and landing were also rough for this particular flight. The lavatory was okay, except for the floor, which was weirdly sticky.

For the Chicago to LA flight, as I mentioned, we had a gate change as well, but it wasn't as big of a hassle as the previous one as the new gate was within a few feet from the original one. Didn't have any complaints with the takeoff and landing. My only complaint is that the plane was a bit unclean. I know that sometimes cleaning crews don't really have a lot of time to do a thorough clean up, but still. A bit of quick sweeping or vacuuming wouldn't hurt. They also did not hand out ear phones to passengers because they apparently ran out. Not that big of a deal...I just took naps in between snacks.

Overall, the flight experience was okay; not bad but not good either. I flew Basic Economy, so I feel like I can't really complain much, but that doesn't mean that there's no room for further improvement. Hopefully, they will actually implement improvements in the future."|american-airlines

My sisters and I booked a flight about 2 months ago from LAX to visit our family in Dallas. About a week ago, we received an email from American Airlines asking us to please change our flight to an earlier one, from 5:30pm to 6:30am the same day because the one we had booked was overcrowded and due to COVID-19 they wanted to decrease the number of passengers for safety reasons. We said that fine and changed our flight over the phone, they said they would send us an email confirmation (they never did). So we got to the airport this morning ready to go and they said our flight wasn't until tomorrow at 6:30am?? So they cut a day off of our trip, and said they couldn't do anything because there is no record of them requesting the change even though we showed them the email?? When we asked to them change our flight back to the one we had originally booked (5:30pm) they said they couldn't because they sold our tickets?? So they asked us to change because it was overcrowded, and then they sold our seats to make it exactly the same number of people?? Literally the most terrible customer service I've ever experienced.

After American Airlines cancelled out flight home twice. Tried to up charge us for our flight home. Then promised we would with my MINOR children together. We get to the airport and find out my MINOR children are sitting away from me with strangers across the airplane!!

The workers are very rude!!"|american-airlines
243|Big fat 0 stars if I could rate you guys ! You customer service is fucking horrible and lazy! You need to clean and sanitize everything. Seats and all! That's why you guys have 1 damn star on yelp. Clearly you guys have issues !|american-airlines
244|"Came here to say what so many have already said before me; AA should be ashamed for putting both their customers and their employees at risk during the COVID pandemic.

As much as the informed among us recognize that it's just stupid to fly right now, some of us don't have a choice, whether that's for a family emergency or other reason (people flying for vacations right now are just in a whole other special category of addled). AA needs to explain to me why Delta (flown on the first leg of my trip to SC last week) managed to REQUIRE face masks on their passengers, AND managed to not overbook their flights to create reasonable distancing on board, AND managed to provide each passenger with a consolation bag (no in-flight service) of water, snack and hand sanitizer....when American Airlines could not even manage to require face masks. My flight home from SC on AA was a nightmare. People crammed together, many opting not to wear face masks because the airline wouldn't require that until May 11, and not even a bottle of water offered. We did appreciate the in-flight entertainment when the attendants did their stand up comedy routine, instructing passengers not to crowd galleyways or bulkheads as the airline is practicing ""safe social distancing"" -- something this airline had failed at before any of us even set foot on the plane due to their irresponsible practices. F you, American Airlines."|american-airlines
245|Social distance my a**. In the airport they say keep social distancing of 6 ft between passengers in the waiting area and boarding line but the flight is completely full and all the seats are occupied. There is not even 6 inches between passengers. As long as they make money , they don't care to follow their own rules|american-airlines
246|My flight was scheduled to leave at 6:32am.  I got to the airport and hour before my flight left.  Unfortunately, forgot my phone in the car so had to call the parking shuttle to come back and pick me up to get my phone and bring me back.  They came right away, I zipped through the security line and ran to my gate.  I got to the gate at 6:18am.  The customer service lady had just shut the door after letting the last passenger through as I arrived to the gate.  I thought she would allow me to go through but unfortunately she refused.  She said I needed to be at the gate at least 15 minutes before the flight left.  I was there 14 minutes before the flight left and she just barely closed the door.  I begged for her to let me on the flight and she refused and said I was late and there was nothing she could do other than put me on stand by for the next flight.  She had no empathy for my situation and was cold and callous.  Seemed she was doing it to teach me a lesson...really?!  Ridiculous customer service.  I usually fly southwest but my company purchased this flight for me using their credit card points.  I would never fly American Airlines by choice...pathetic customer service!  Sure it was my fault for forgetting my phone...but I was there 14 minutes before my flight left, not 15 and was not able to get on my flight.   Incredible.|american-airlines
247|I've flown American one time. That was the LAST time ever. The employees were rude and stuck up from check in to flight attendants.  My flight was very late. When we were able to board, long wait to get on then I get to the plane door and an attendant said stop, we have to serve drinks to the first class passengers. They held passengers from boarding so they could serve drinks to the first class. Oh my god I couldn't believe it. Never again American!!!|american-airlines
248|"American Airlines just called and offered me a measly $50 voucher to use towards another flight. My 35 min flight  from Dallas to Austin cost $290. It took 4 hours not to mention the 2 hours I had to be there before hand. They can keep their $50 because I wouldn't give them 1 extra penny towards another flight. American has dropped from #1 Airlines to 9th in recent years and I can see why and this information came from a client who has flown with American over 20 years.
----------------------------------

This is the email I sent to America Airlines before I was offered a $50 voucher...

Good Afternoon it has taken me a couple of weeks to calm down and rid myself of tears concerning my flight. I'm a part-time self employed grandmother on social security.
This was the first time I chose to fly a 40 minute trip to see my granddaughter and it ended up taking 4 hours not to mention the two hours I had to be at the airport before hand. I continue to tear up eveytine I think of the money waisted to get there quicker whim I could have been driven in a shorter time."|american-airlines
249|"My flight was cancelled at the end of August due to mechanical issues.  Okay.  Things happen.  
American Airlines, continued to ""delay"" the flight in the system - 3:00 take off, 5:00 take off, oh sorry 8 pm take off"" rather than cancel it.  As such, they kept trying to reroute us on flights that were NEVER going to leave the airport that day.  We ended up having to stay 24 hours.  

Ok that's frustrating but it is what it is. We paid our expenses for dinner, hotel and Uber up front and kept the receipts as instructed by the person on the phone to avoid the THREE HOUR voucher line.  

Two months later, I have not been reimbursed a cent, do not get responses to emails and was told (after holding over an hour for customer service) that there is no way to talk to someone in refunds.  She suggested that I FAX (in 2019) and ask them to call me at a set time.  I did.  No call back.  

I have spent hours at this point messing with this and am no better off than the day I missed my kids competition because we could not take off - except for the $17 voucher they offered me for food.  What an insult.  

It is ABSOLUTELY INFURIATING to me that American Airlines does not have a system that allows you to TALK to someone and they do not respond to my repeated emails for weeks at a time."|american-airlines
250|"Ruining My Honeymoon Already!

American decided to change my direct flight from LA to Cabo without any notice. I had planned an early flight for my honeymoon.

Arriving early I had booked a special ride from the airport to the resort. Then upon arrival booked a ""party cruise"" offered by the resort. A great way to kick off the first day of our honeymoon!

Now the flight was changed to 2pm! We will not make it in time for the cruise, and I will have to make other arrangements for transportation - return flight was changed to a later time, leaving us with no where to spend most of the day after checking out from the resort - now we have to rent a car!

I'm addition to all of that, we have 3 pets boarding - we will not be home in time to pick them up and now have to pay for an extra night of pet boarding for all 3 pets!

When I called to request that we be upgraded to first class because of all the extra expenses we will now have, I was told "" there is nothing we can do, sorry."" I think it is the least that American Airlines can do for us after screwing us out of a day of our honeymoon. We already can't have the wedding we planned due to COVID-19 and we're looking so forward to this get away, now shortened and with nothing to make up for it!

This is how they treat their American Airline Card Holders! It's sad and pathetic that they couldn't even offer a first class upgrade for the trouble on the same flight, as there are seats in first class still available!"|american-airlines
251|Worst airline I've ever traveled with. Everyone is rude and do not know anything. They are very unprofessional and unorganized. Would not ever travel with them again.|american-airlines
252|American Airlines does not follow social distancing.... we were packed on a 737 like sardines nothing about this flight was sanitary. I was under the impression that people should maintain a 6 feet social distance. But here we are packed to capacity. Delta would never!|american-airlines
253|Whatever you do, do not fly American during the pandemic. They didn't monitor the on boarding whatsoever. The plane is more than packed, they even had to check my carry bag in. Seats are filthy and flight attendants are not taking proper precautions. This is very concerning.|american-airlines
254|"After boarding plane were asked to get off stating fuel door issue.  After the 2 hour delay we take off and miss our connecting flight in miami by 15 minutes to aruba where vaca is planned.  We then book the flight for next morning and figure well stay in miami for the day and overnight.  We find out our luggage is getting held for next days flight or we can wait 2 to 8 hours in airport until they find it.  Then, they give us a free night at the miami airport hotel which was for lack of a better term, horrendous (rather than in our paid for hotel in aruba).  They were nice enough to give us food vouchers for $12 per person in total.  Considering we had wait 20 hours this was the final slap in the face and didnt eve cover breakfast.
I understand problems, delays etc but the way they handle this situation is nothing but corporate greed and no regard for customer service."|american-airlines
255|"LAX - HORRIBLE!!!!

I will never again take American Airlines. We're supposed to be in Disneyland but we've been waiting for 45 minutes for our luggage. After taking a shuttle across the tarmac to get to the baggage claim.

San Francisco to LAX should not be so difficult. This is a huge FAIL.

What a horrible airline. Can't even get the basics right..."|american-airlines
256|0.4 miles away from American Airlines|american-airlines
257|These people are destined for the dustbin of busted and broke airlines, and rightfully so. Customers are treated like a bothersome insect, to be brushed aside and crushed without consideration. Customer service is treated like a cost-center. Instead of driving customer away, why don't you try to delight the customers? The insanity of the voice recognition automation is only just the tip of the iceberg. Try getting through to AA Advantage miles cust service. They make it impossible!  US Govt': PLEASE don't bail out airlines!! They need to bankrupt!!!|american-airlines
258|If I could give less than 1 star I would. I called today, waited on hold for an hour and 20 minutes only to be told by the person on the phone that they couldn't help me and that those were the facts... then she literally hung up on me while I was talking. Talk about terrible customer service.... this is one family of customers they've lost for life.|american-airlines
259|I was on flight 2460 to Cleveland Sunday. It was a full flight and the passengers spent 3.5 hours in delays without us being let off the plane. I contracted Covid as a result. Perhaps Americans Airlines should reconsider there Covid policies in these situations.|american-airlines
260|"I will never take an American Airline flight again. I called three days in advance to ask if I could change the time of my flight, as my grandfather passed away and I need to attend his memorial service. Your agent Maria, kept me on the phone for over 30 minutes to ask me what my grandfather's name was, what the funeral home's name and address are, the phone number, and the time of the service.

All of this to simply change the time on a return flight. The agent agreed to ""let me change the flight time"" but with a $189 charge, which I am not able to pay. Shame on your company policies and your agents for their insensitivity and inflexibility. You should be embarrassed to have your employee grill a customer on details of a funeral simply to change the time of a flight. You are by far the worst airline I have ever had the misfortune of traveling with. I would advise all others to stay away."|american-airlines
261|"COVIDiots. Complete COVIDiots.

American Airlines failed to enact any kind of meaningful social distancing protocol:

---No attempts to space out passengers on the plane (even though there were plenty of empty seats)
---No attempts to enforce mask wearing by passengers, let alone correct mask wearing.
---No hand sanitizer (good thing I brought my own).
---No temperature checks.
---EVEN THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS were sitting around without masks on.

Do not fly this airline if you want to stay safe."|american-airlines
262|Disappointed today with American Airlines as it is COVID and they booked THE WHOLE FLIGHT FROM FRONT TO BACK with passengers. Not to mention i had my N95 mask on and was told to take it off and I could only use the cheapy useless blue paper masks for regulations??? BUT YET THEY BOOK A FLIGHT TO MAXIMUM CAPACITY? Ive flown with this airline for YEARS and am just utterly shocked at their response to this pandemic. Very disappointed|american-airlines
263|"I flew FIRST CLASS from Tokyo to Los Angeles at a cost of 6,000 USD. The flight attendant, Christine, didn't greet or give me or anyone the customary drink or assistance as she was too busy flirting with another passenger. When my headset didn't work she accused me of breaking it when I just got on the plane. Things went downhill from there. I asked for another headset and she said none was available so I would just have to ""suck it up"". Food was cold and if I wanted any drinks I would need to go to the galley and ask as she didn't respond to the attendant button. When at the galley she just rolled her eyes. I went to AAA where I booked to complain and my agent said ""they don't care"". Facebook has several accounts that parody American Airlines Complaints. One finger salute to you AA. Should be renamed As*hole Airlines. I'll take my $6,000 somewhere else. Never again."|american-airlines
264|"Awful customer service.

As a Platinum member I expected some better service when I called and explained missing an outbound flight but needing to still catch my return flight.

Instead they explained I would now need to pay a 500 dollar new seat. That's how much a one way ticket would be now!! That doesn't make sense as I have the seat. If anything I should pay the one way ticket on date of booking the ticket before.

It seemed ludicrous as literally they can now sell my outbound ticket and make money there, but yet they want to make money again and charge me $500

After explaining if I cancelled their ticket I could get a flight with a different airline back for less money and actually save money. They still wouldn't let me take that flight back. They didn't care and just kept denying this was money making.

I asked them ""so you're willing for a platinum member to go to another airline now"" and yes they were. So now I've cancelled my flight and the credit will now cover my new flight on a different airline and some left over. What a shame I was willing to stick with them even though I'd save money, but they had no care about helping me.

My wife's Platinum and on route to qualify for Platinum pro this year, but they didn't care so now we're both going to start putting all our flights through another airline and telling all our colleagues the nightmare that customer service is for American.

What a shame their greed, and desperation to take advantage of people gets in the way of common sense."|american-airlines
265|I am thoroughly disappointed with my travels with American Airlines this time, and I will likely not take AA anymore in the future, even with credit still left on my account. I booked a round-trip direct flight from DCA to LAX 3 months in advance. However, without explanation, both flights were changed to layover flights with a stop in Dallas. Then, they changed my seats without explanation. Even worse, my flight from LAX to DFW was delayed, causing me to miss my connection from DFW to DCA. In addition to the delay, the connection time of merely 40 minutes was unacceptable. Furthermore, AA changed the gates last minute for my flight into DFW and my flight out of DFW, causing me to run through 2 terminals only to be blocked at the gate even though there were still about 15 minutes left. I now have to stay at a hotel overnight, miss a whole day of work, and pay for meals and travel fees out of my own pocket. The worst part, their compensation to me was a 12-dollar meal voucher...|american-airlines
266|"FLY WITH SOMEONE ELSE!!!!

Just don't fly American. If you can pick any other airline just do it.

Bought my wife a ticket so she could travel with me for government business. My plans got cancelled so I called to ask what could be done about my wife's ticket and was told that literally nothing could be done. We won't be on that flight, but I tipped American $550 for nothing.

The customer service representative was terrible and didn't even acknowledge that what they were doing sucked for me. I asked him ""So I am just out $550?"" And he said ""Yeah, you are."" Incredible.

FLY WITH SOMEONE ELSE!!!!!"|american-airlines
267|"Seeing so many 1 star reviews I am sure not sure If I have just been lucky or if other people have been unlucky :)

I fly American a couple times a year and we have always been on-time and received great service. We did have to wait about 30 mins for our gate in LAX but the Captain kept us updated about the wait.

Our connecting flight to Maui left right on time. The gate agents were friendly and the flight attendants very welcoming and provided excellent service from gate to gate. We were offered pre-departure cocktails as soon as we boarded and given bottled waters right after take off.

The lunch selection of ""pork chop"" or ""chickpeas"" was very strange for a flight to Hawaii and the food was not great by any means. The leather seats however were very comfortable and the large seat back entertainment screens had enough movies, TV shows and games to last for days.

We arrived a few minutes early to Maui and the Captain came out of the cockpit to thank everyone for flying with American. Hopefully my luck continues!"|american-airlines
268|"LAX to SAN- fortunate to be living

Small regional jet. No seat assignments until right before boarding.

No drink service.

Cleanliness: average

Seats: tight and very uncomfortable

Landing: The worst landing I've experienced in over a decade. Felt like the plane was out of control during landing. We ended up veering off toward the left and came to a sudden and abrupt stop. Then, the plane taxied to the gate. I felt fortunate to be alive."|american-airlines
269|The crew at the gate on flight 5030 on 10.29.20 at Newport News Airport were so very helpful during a delay caused by a boo boo on the planes nose/weather radar. The app was sending people on different connections and didn't seem to be doing it for most people. They helped bout 30 customers  find alternative routes one by one at the desk... and me multiple times because of reroutes on my reroutes due to weather.  They even kept track of the fact that I left for a minute for a restroom break, missed an announcement and caught up with me before I sat at the wrong gate too long. They also made sure my bag would not get lost when they caught on that the auto selection from using the app was trying to send it somewhere else. This is not an easy job. They kept their cool and were kind and diligent with each person. I wish I noted their names. Thank you for keeping us all strait! I would rather be re-routed any day than ride a plane with no weather radar.... so thank you to the pilot as well.|american-airlines
270|This used to be my favorite airline not anymore the flights prices were ok but the check in bag fees got me never again! The passengers wasn't wearing mask it was not social distancing at all on the plane  and the employees at the counter wasn't pleasant at all. I love southwest not only they're  fare  is very affordable during this pandemic but they offer non stop flights and they're  flight attendants are super courteous  I will encourage my family n friends to fly SW American Airlines get a one star step your game up!|american-airlines
271|"This airline is a joke, never fly AA unless you have to. In Charlotte, plane has been sitting here since time of departure. They have no crew and keep delaying, going on 3 hours now.
They roll out a free drink and snack cart as if that helps. Most AA employees walking by loading their pockets with the stuff, not passengers."|american-airlines
272|"I have been flying with AA for years. Since COVID, I have flown with them 9 times to volunteer in NC. The check in staff are rude, condescending and really don't care. Is it because they are union or because they know if I raise my voice I automatically get kicked out.
Just now, I stood in line to speak with someone about stand by on flight scheduled to leave in 10 min. After 3-4 minutes of hearing the gossip, I asked if I could get on standby. The person said she's too busy too look and asked that I step aside. I did. Then another person came up and all three were just talking. No one was on computer and they were talking about how busy it was yesterday. 5 min went by and I walked up to someone. I asked about standby and was told because they checked my bag at the ramp, I can't go on an earlier flight. I said that makes sense because I've taken an offer from them to take a different flight to different airport even!  I called AA and they said that doesn't make sense and for me to get name of person that said that. I went back and asked for her name and badge number. She said Molly, I'm the supervisor and you don't need my badge number. I'm so upset with how AA treats their customers. The laziness of flight attendants playing on phone during flight, the rudeness at the airport, and the lack of leadership holding their staff accountable. With this pandemic we have choices! I've been reluctant to change d/t status and miles. But... I'm going to use up those miles and boycott AA. I'm taking my business as well as my fellow medical volunteers with me. Delta, here we come. The bar is low so I have hope!"|american-airlines
273|"On a flight from LAX to Miami AA damaged my kid's stroller and don't want to compensate as ""it does not affect your baby's safety"". A part of the umbrella holder has gone. Well, first of all, the sun in Miami did harm my baby's skin no matter what you do to stay out of the sun, so I can consider it as a safety tool. Secondly, now the stroller is scratched and obviously, a part is missing. Fortunately, the scratch is not that deep, but it is a sign of impact that made a turning mechanism to disconnect. It is very hard to take it off with hands, It was designed to stay in no matter what.
Well, thank you American Airlines for the great first experience of traveling with a kid, good job!"|american-airlines

We were ALL supposed to arrive back together on the same flights but instead only 3 of us made it back, and only 1 of our baggage made it! It is a little over 24hrs later and the 2 other people from our group are still not home! 1 has a secured seat and the other is on standby in Philadelphia after spending the night in Miami waiting for a flight.

279|American Airlines allowed for full seat flights during COVID in September, unlike other airlines which were keeping middle seats open to allow decent distancing between passengers. Additionally, the airline attendants did not check to ensure that all passengers were wearing their masks correctly. The gentleman next to me would either take off his mask or wear it around his mouth but not his nose. Not only that, he was coughing repeatedly the entire time on the plane. When doing their final walk through before take-off, the flight attendant even looked directly at the gentleman next to me and didn't say a word. Additionally, three planes on a four-leg flight trip were delayed due to maintenance. The delays ranged from as little as 30 minutes to nearly two-hours. Instead of having all passengers depart the plane, they had all passengers remain on the fully packed plane while they tried to resolve said maintenance issue. Furthermore, the flight attendants appear to not keep in good communication with those at the airports. Due to the maintenance delays two of the connecting flights were nearly missed. On the last leg, we missed our connecting flight by mere seconds because the in-air flight attendants did not communicate with the airport staff to hold the plane for those that are supposed to be on the connecting flight. Because we missed the connecting flight, we had to get on the next flight out. That being said, we had paid for extra leg room on our original flight, but because we were getting on another flight we were placed on the very last row of the flight. I was told by the attendant that American Airlines will reimburse us for the seats we paid for. To date (December almost January 2021), I have not received a notice from American Airlines about said reimbursement. Needless to say, that was the worse experience on any flight I've ever had and if I can help it will never voluntarily choose to purchase flights from American Airlines again. I would give American Airlines zero stars if possible.|american-airlines
280|I don't usually write reviews.  When i had just flown with American Airlines, i had the worst experience anyone can dream of. I had booked my flight priority (paid extra for that) , had my instrument with a small carry on. They would not let me through security , stating I can't have both instrument and carry-on. (Even though on their online website it clearly states one may have an instrument along with carry-on) after respectfully trying my hardest to explain and show them the law, they not only ignored me, but practically spat me in the face. I Had to rebook flight because by the time I finally was almost through security i had missed the flight. Flight attendant D. Horne. Aka Sarah from my Miami to Ny Flight gave me a terrible experience along with her other colleagues, i had specifically purchased a scarf mask online that better protects one from bad bacterias. Im sitting on plane with my scarf mask and D Horne/Sarah comes along and begins to embarrass me in public handing me the classic blue masks that don't do much.  I really don't appreciate your service American Airlines.  Terrible experience. I hope you continue getting repeatedly sued, and eventually are forced to declare bankruptcy.|american-airlines
281|"I know, I know! I couldn't believe it myself. When I flew to NYC a couple years ago, it was absolutely terrible! This time (March 2018), it was a completely different experience.

Food:
I was dreading to fly on American because it's a long flight to NYC and I was in the main cabin. I couldn't believe it, but they fed us and it was free! They even gave us two options to choose from. I chose the cheese platter, and it was very decent.

Fleet and Entertainment:
The fleet was much newer and cleaner this time. We had individual screens even in the main cabin. It may not sound  anything too special, but given that there were no individual monitors on my American flight to NYC a couple years ago, this is huge. Beside, on my return flight, I took Alaska back. There were no individual screens. They were renting out tablets for $10! I love Alaska, but shame on you!

I rarely fly American. So, this could be an isolated case. So, I don't want to be carried away and give them 5 stars, but I think they deserve 4 stars based on this specific flight I took to NYC.

283|Do not Fly with  American Airlines. I have certified ESA animals that they wouldn't allow me to board my flight twice to St. Maarten for school from DFW. The agents are incompetent, insensitive, racist and uncaring for those of us who have Documented Disabilities, certificates of approval from The Inspection Department of Agriculture and Ministry of Tourism to bring both of my ESA cats with me plus their veterinarian, USDA certificate, and yet they still denied me transportation not once but twice. I've experienced emotional distress, panic attacks and it has costs me over $2600 to prepare my ESA animals to fly. They lied on me say my Covid test was invalid, it was not , I need a physical exam, oh my debit card doesn't work to oh you were here last week , so he took over an hour to even put my luggage in the system. Never fly with this company, never if you want a piece of mind and treated with dignity and respect. Not lied on and to by the managers at DFW terminal C-21.  Just don't choose another airline.|american-airlines
284|Absolutely terrible that in the midst of a pandemic , they would deny a refund to a passenger that was covid positive.

286|"I don't miss flying. I don.t miss having to give AA twice as many accumulated miles from my account to get the flights I wanted in a large aircraft even though those flights arrived with many empty seats. I don't miss being stuck in a plane not much bigger than Sky King used to fly on tv. I don't miss feeling squashed in between people in a seat too crowded to be comfortable in, while a empty row up ahead remains empty because no one wanted to pay for those ""preferred"" seats. I don't miss flying from CA to Chicago with no food available, and my checked luggage nowhere to be found. At least my bag did show up in time to make my next flight because of the 5 hour delay. I do miss the flight crews--they were the best. Now I just get in my car, stay in a nice hotel overnight half way to my destination, have a nice relaxed breakfast the next morning, and continue to my condo in SC. No rental car needed at the airport, no lines. No schedule. No having to deal with rude AA employees in the airports if you try to correct a problem caused by AA. They almost always treated you badly, and you just had to try to make believe they really were trying their best to help you. But they really didn;t like you, and it showed. With the coronavirus, a lot of AA aircraft are sitting at airports all the time because so few people are flying. As Toby Keith would ask--How do you like me now?"|american-airlines

288|Beware when booking a flight on American Airlines. They are not practicing social distancing and it appears that they do not care about Covid. Returned back from Chicago to Los Angeles on Saturday and the flight was packed full to capacity. American Airlines does not allow you to choose your seat unless you pay upfront otherwise, they will choose your seats for you when you check in.I was traveling with my son and my husband, so the system put two seats together and then put the other seat as a middle seat five rows away. I inquired when we arrived at the airport to change our seat to sit together and they said that the flight was full. Why would the system split us up like that when we are in the middle of Covid. The seat next to my husband and son was empty until the last minute where they had allowed a standby passengers to board the flight. They try to gouge you for money for every little thing and they were not enforcing the mask rule. The gentleman sitting next to my husband and son did not wear his mask the whole time and my husband was trying to motion to the flight attendant to ask him to put on his mask.  she pretended not to even see him. If you have a choice. Do not fly on American Airlines. It is not worth the hassle and risking your safety.  Poor service and lack of courtesy for people who are flying on the airline. I will never fly American again.|american-airlines
289|We flew from LAX to Nashville. We booked without a layover, but because of COVID they rebooked our flight months later to a flight with a layover in Dallas ( for the same price). In Dallas our connecting flight was a smaller fully packed (definitely not COVID safe plane) with no overhead bin space. Both flights had no inflight entertainment and only one gave us a pack of cookies. It was the worst and most ridiculous flight I've ever been on. Will never fly American again.|american-airlines

291|Pilot shows up unfit for duty miss my trip out a bunch of money trip insurance does not cover intoxicated pilots and american says our bad heres 175 voucher. I'm out thousands and they offer 175.|american-airlines
292|After lack of bathrooms in the terminal, I get on a plane with lack of WiFi. No wifi so no free entertainment on your devices. An apology from the captain is not getting me service. At least there was a movie on the TVs but it was instant nauseating to have to watch Instant Family. Good I always bring a book. Thanks for giving another great experience. Hope my next flight works out as amazing or even more so :) luckily my sarcasm can laugh this one away as I'm grateful I wasn't stuck 9 hours on a plane without food or water like the last time I flew AA hooray:)|american-airlines
293|My experience is very bad with American Airline, I had booked a ticket for a person from Toronto to Mexico who was visiting from Mexico as a guest and on 29/12/2019 she had to back Mexico in an emergency, that time she had no money to go back, I offered my Credit Card her for bookings on American Airline on 27/12/2019 which Sunday after booking, after booking we called American Airline that we booked on your carrier to Mexico and there's stopover at DFW Dallas International Airport, do a passenger required a transit visa in USA CSR said hope there'll be no problems since she's onward connections to Mexico and she is not leaving the airport or going into the city, that's all we got information from CSR of American Airlines, then we proceed to Pearson Int'l on 29th of December 2019 and she's been offload by saying that she's not holding proper visa, it means the CSR who has provided us information on telephone was incorrect, then I had to buy her ticket on Air Canada, after she left I contacted so many times American Airline explaining the situation that if you cannot refund, then issue a coupon on my name because I have paid that huge amount from my credit card helped someone, and I am Canadian citizen and I can fly anywhere being not required transit visa for America. They are very rude and and they don't want to either my money or issue a coupon on my because they are big fraud airline in my view. I request each and everyone do not use American Airlines|american-airlines
294|"Booked a flight from California to New York on June 25 for July 13. The plane looked empty and I was able to secure a window seat with nobody next to me.
Last minute I had to change my travel a few days later , I cancelled online and had to wait 45 minutes for AA to call me back to use the credit.
On the new flight on July 15 they tell me I would have to pay to secure a window or aisle seat and middle seats have been filling and selling since July 1.
So let's think about this. AA gets a huge corporate bailout because the airline industry is hit by Covid as are the rest of us.. they then decide on July 1 when there is a rise in cases in California and  Texas (connection was in DFW)  to start filling their planes and charging $ to secure a safer location on the flights. Total disregard for humanity. I'm glad I switched to a southwest flight where they are still only selling at a capacity that eliminates middle seats. That wasn't so hard was it? American is the second worse usa carrier next to United now.... what's next? Will customers have to pay extra to secure a seatbelt that works or be closer to a working emergency exit? This is a matter of life and death for some. Middle seats should not be sold and aisle and windows should not be up sold during Covid and continued rise in cases."|american-airlines
295|"Sorry, not sorry. My review will not be a low rating one.

I missed my morning flight thanks to 3 hours of LA traffic and Spirit didnt let me through to my gate when I still had 40 minutes prior to takeoff. So I bit the bullet and booked another flight online which left 3 hours later. Luckily, Miss Pat Jones at (AA) check in was able to assist me in getting back home at an earlier time. Customer service is key in my world, so thank you Pat!

I'm sure that most of the people writing these low rated reviews will still be choosing American Airlines as their transportation if the price is right.... #jussayin"|american-airlines
296|They had the worst customer experience I have ever experienced. They told me that they didn't care if I ever booked with them again. They were extremely difficult to work with and kept trying to talk over me. They told me just to buy new tickets (tickets that I had already purchased and been charged for but hadn't been sent a voucher). WILL NEVER FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES EVER AGAIN!|american-airlines
297|"American is filling the middle seats. I left from Arizona where the virus is a hot mess. I am so sorry that I flew after just hearing on the news that passengers just got sick on a Delta flight that was also packed.
I got a paper bag with a tiny bottle of water and a small bag of peanuts for a long ride. Think First class and Economy plus got the same bag.
Airlines are put for survival. How much worse can it get?
No you know why we need regulation something our president wants to eliminate.
Don't fly because you may get sick."|american-airlines
298|"Another fantastic flight on flight 23 from jfk to lax today. The attendants were awesome!!! The only reason to get up was the restroom.

Other than that they kept me happy with snacks and a very delicious chicken wrap.

Although window seats aren't always my favorite, the flight came in early and the captain guided us through the turbulence making us feel safe.

Great job AA flight 23!!

300|"I purchased a round trip ticket.  American Airlines cancelled my flight two days in a row, due to ""mechanical issues"".  Would not refund my tickets over the phone or at the ticket counter; they said I had to do this online.  The webpage also stated they would not be able to refund the flight as it was basic economy and this is a non-refundable ticket.  

I am very disappointed in their method of conducting business in this instance.  However, I am angered at the culture this company has created.  Their employees have 0 sense of customer service.  Also, their procedures do not allow for a human being to use common sense to fix an issue, rather just have them follow procedures that do not work.  

I do not recommend American Airlines, unless you're stranded with little hope of survival, have lost the ability to see and a double amputee."|american-airlines
301|Shame on you, American Airlines!! My husband just flew on your airline with a full flight. N95 not allowed to be worn. You're not practicing social distancing!!|american-airlines
302|"This airline sucks. We were in Santa Fe, noticed their flight was an hour late. Planned to be at airport an hour early to the later flight.

1 hour before the delayed time, they texted to say they were on time. We hauled ass to the airport, and they closed us out 20 minutes before the time.

I have video and pics and screenshots of the texts of the entire thing.

DO NOT FLY THESE GUYS. Everyone here at Santa Fe from the TSA reps, Hertz and airport staff says they are jerks too. And that everyone has similar problems here. If you travel, you'd be better off to walk. :)"|american-airlines
303|Here's what I am struggling with this week.  Someone with the same name as mine was able to use my American Airlines miles to book a ticket with my full name, DOB and such because American Airlines gave them my account information over the phone.  Here's the kicker, American Airlines isn't doing anything about it!!! It is up to me to track this person down and get it settled.  They REFUSE to reimburse me for the miles used even though it was completely their mistake. They breached the security of my account and all the information that I had tied to that account.  Never mind that this person flew on a plane using my name and the information that goes with it, like my known traveler number.  WTH!!! And they are doing NOTHING about it!! I look forward to your comments and feel free to repost.|american-airlines
304|We will never fly with AA again! We flew to MN on July 2, 2020 and the flight was packed out! So much for social distancing! If you want a real airline, fly with Delta! They have it down. Middle row was open and the plane was only 50% full.|american-airlines
305|"Horrible and condescending.  The flight crew o. AA1489, November 30, 2019. Out of Newark to Charlotte, the 2:30 flight that got delayed til after 3:30, and put us in great danger of missing our connecting flight, could have not have cared less about helping us get off the plane quickly or get to our gate.

When we complained,  they were all shitty and condescending. Assholes"|american-airlines
306|If I could give this Airline zero stars I would. What are they doing to STOP the spread of COVID-19. Not one single thing. On my flight from LAX TO MIA. There were no signs. No social distancing during boarding. Nothing at all. The flight was PACKED TO CAPACITY. No skipping seats. This was my flight and last time ever flying this airline. But the gag is the flight attendant had the nerve to yell at people for bringing their mask down. Friend! There's no social distancing at all. Why try to start now! I literally am appalled|american-airlines
307|Wow!  Kim recently helped me with a flight change, to the point that I hunted down how to send in a positive review of her service, I truly hope she hears of this message to AA.  We had a flight change that was going to have us in a 5 hour layover and not getting home until 10:30 p.m..  The issue is, we have a 2 year old and a 6 year old, so as you can image, that is not ideal for anyone.  Kim went above and beyond my expectation in getting us moved to another flight, with a very short layover and getting us home around 6 p.m..  I don't know if she'll ever know how much that meant to us.  I called and waited on hold for quite awhile and I'm so glad I did.  She resolved my concern in less than 15 minutes.  God surely put me on the phone with the best person for the job.  AA is blessed to have her on their team.  Thank you so much Kim and AA!|american-airlines
308|"Worst customer service .  Don't fly American if you can avoid it. They needlessly check bags for no reason. Flown this flight a dozen times with same bag.

I walk in plane to see a number of the same size bags in overhead bin.  They pick and choose who to inconvenience, not selecting all equally. I've seen them do this to other folks before who's bags could clearly fit in overhead. The flight wasn't full, I had at least four seats in my immediate area empty with plenty of overhead space.  No rational or logic to checking my bag btw on my flight back on the same plane my bag wasn't checked and fit in overhead with difficulty.  Just useless effort of LAX's American Airlines's staff time and energy.  Seems they could channel that energy toward improving customer service experience for passengers.

Waited ten minutes for supervisor Julie Ann who helped in no capacity.

American Airlines days of customer service are gone.

Horrible - will never fly them again."|american-airlines
309|I paid for a direct flight since I was traveling during Covid-19 and wanted to experience the least amount of exposure to others. I booked my flight 3 months in advance to assure I would get the flights and seats I wanted. I was contacted 2 weeks before my trip (after my hotels and rental cars were already booked) to let me know that my flight was changed to a layover and that my seats were changed as well to be seated separate from my wife. I called and waited on hold for over an hour, spoke to representative that did nothing. I called again and again waited over an hour to address the seating issue, they helped me at least change my seat back to be beside my wife until an hour before the flight they changed it back to be separate. I contacted customer service who referred me to customer relations who also did nothing. I will be canceling my corporate membership with this airline and will never fly with them again.|american-airlines

314|"It's unbelievable what's going on with this airline. My flights get changed and I can't even get a refund. What happened to all these commercials (we're in this together!) We are until I ask for a refund on a flight that American Airlines changed. This completely ruins my plans. On TV they care, their commercials are heart warming and touching, but in real life their message is (You're fuck, you're in this alone.)

On top of this I purchased a first class ticket. The reps tells me its actually a discounted first class ticket. I said how was I suppose to know there was only one first class ticket option. Even if I wanted to purchase another version of first class it's not available on the website. This is no way to be treated during a time like this."|american-airlines
315|I wish there was an option For no stars... by far the worst airline to ever fly with. I had been in line for almost 2 hours waiting on J. Brian the baggage attendant to check my bags when I got to the line finally I was told I would not make my flight. This happened to 3 other individuals on this flight because of this baggage attendant. He was rude and began lecturing us about how we need to be at a different kiosk after he told us that he would help at that kiosk. I paid a heavy bag fee of $100 which I understand but what I didn't understand was his attitude. He started rolling his eyes, slamming my passport down, pounding the keyboards, and ignoring all my questions. He was doing all of this in front of his supervisor. Once something was said to his supervisor, he said something to J. Brian who did acknowledge anything nor apologize. He told me he would get me on a flight that I now have 3 connecting flights, and I am coming in 4 hours later than expected. American Airlines has 0 customer service and no courtesy for their customers. Your company should re-evaluate your customer service training.|american-airlines
316|"@AmericanAir The reason for this compliant is because in all my years of flying with AA i have never,ever been so disrespected from a flight attendant.
I am 6 months pregnant,doctors highly recommend that pregnant women wear compression socks when ever you plan a flight, these socks prevent your blood from clogging in your legs,if this where to happen blood clogged could end up anywhere in my body jeopardizing my pregnancy and myself.Pregnant women need good blood circulation and these socks help.Before the plane even closed the doors(people where still boarding)i wanted to go to the bathroom just to put my socks on.
When i was about to open the door this male flight attendant( called Craig)did not let me in, he said that the bathroom could not be used, that if i would try to use it the flight would be delayed and he Wasn't going to let that happen.  I kindly explained to him that i was 6 months pregnant, i explained that i was not going to use the bathroom, i just wanted to step in it to take off my pants so i could put my compression socks on. He raised his voice to me in front of other passengers and the female flight attendant that he did not care if i was pregnant and needed to put "" those socks"" on for prevention, that if i needed to put them on i should get off the plane,use the bathroom at the airport and get on an other flight latter.
OH MY GOD, this is not the way AA treats their customers.
After repeatedly telling him that i needed to put these socks on period,the other flight attendant(Jennifer)took me to the bathroom and let me in. I finally put my socks on. This man did not even try to understand. ALL THIS WITH THE PLANE PARKED.
My husband spoke quietly(we didn't want to put on a show, thats not the way my family is) with Jennifer and asked her if she could give him the rude attendants info, she even wrote us a letter saying she was sorry for everything. I can forward Picture of the note.
Very sad experience and way to start our Babymoon.

Worst male flight attendant I ever encountered (his name is Creig), just a really bad experience while pregnant, not the way i planned to start our babymoon.

I will NEVER fly American Airlines again, unless they refund my money."|american-airlines
318|"Its no surprise to me that AA has 1.5 stars.
It was my first time booking a flight. I chose to go through kayak and something happened with my Internet that caused some lag, and the wrong date was selected. Tried to call AA and corrrect the issue aNd was told there was no way it could be fixed, but that I can buy ANOTHER ticket.

Why would I support a business like this..
So i went ahead and stopped the transaction through my bank. I have no plans to ever pay for the incorrect ticket. So it can go to collections for all i care. I Might go ahead and purchase another ticket with the correct dates just out of spite, because why let a con-artist-business stop me from having my mini vacation.
But, then again this may be the first and last time i ever buy a plane ticket, having learned airlines provide zero customer service.

Funny thing is, the wrong flight and the correct flight are the same price.

Was able to upgrade easily with the gate agent who was very friendly and pick which seat I wanted in a virtually empty business class cabin area (the first of two areas was already quite full).  

Once onboard, the FAs were absolutely fantastic, and really make you feel like they value your business, and the food and drink and comforts were simply amazing.  

Great craft beer, nice touch on the travel bag with high quality stuff inside, and wow those seats and pillows are comfortable.   I am not a huge fan of flying, but will pick British Airways anywhere I go if I can."|british-airways

Absolutely my favorite Airlines! I'll ignore all the whiny American reviews and share my personal experience with British Airways. From check-in to final landing nothing but top notch service. I'm not just saying it 'cause I'm really digging the equestrian boots and hair-in-bun look. I'm saying it because I was treated, dare I say it, like royalty on all my flights to London and parts of Europe.

I especially loved the super long 12-hours flight from Los Angeles to London. Wait. Who loves 12-hours flights? Okay, I admit I don't exactly love 12-hours flights lol, but if I had to... and in this case we must fly. I choose British Airways hands down. On my LAX to LHR flight I was offered two meals, focusing on British brands, wine, headsets for personal movies, I watched two full movies flying over, and three full movies flying back. And I'm talking latest movies too! Still with enough time to comfortably sleep a few! Drinks were offered every so often too. I mean even the mandatory emergency announcement was shown with the best Brit humour.

In the end, I'm now a Euro traveler club member with British Airways. I will fly no other airlines if I have a choice. I'm loyal like that! Keep doing what you do British Airways. Just being pleasant & nice. Wow how refreshing!

'Til next time. Ta!"|british-airways
325|"BA was awful before privatization, great when Maggie Thatcher launched it out of the nest as a public company, and now has regressed a bit to generic.  There's still the veneer of British cool politeness and efficiency, but underneath it's become just like any other airline.

It was a business trip so the client sprang for First Class.  With BA this used to feel like royalty.  Nowadays, it feels more like just another upgrade on American or Iberia (two of their codeshare partners).  BA has now merged with Iberia, which might have dragged down the level of service.

Their First Class lounge in Heathrow definitely employs the A-team, and that was by far the highlight of the trip.  In flight the food was just OK and the service was just OK.  I wasn't paying, so had a low threshold for being pleased.  

Low points were somewhat rubbery food, and an air con vent that was condensing and dripping on my arm.   There were no seats to move away from the drip, so a towel draped over my arm was the best seat available.

All in all, it saddens me a bit that a once mediocre, then truly great, airline is now back in just-ok territory."|british-airways
326|"BA used to be a top-notch airline, but that has obviously changed. Their handling of our reservation, ticketing, delays, and lost luggage during our trip this past winter was atrocious. We were diverted from our original itinerary after weather problems in Seattle, then we were stuck in Boston for 13 hours after no sleep and missing our flight to London Heathrow even though we arrived just in time to board because we were not issued boarding passes in Seattle.

Once we finally arrived in London, almost 2 days late, our luggage was nowhere to be found and BA could not even locate our bags in their system. Their lost baggage office in London was unfriendly and unhelpful. We finally received our bags after 4 days, just in time to depart the following day for Paris, and we were not compensated for the immense inconvenience of having to wear the same clothes for 4+ days and having none of the personal and hygienic items we had packed.

Fortunately, I brought my medications in my carry-on, so I did not have to try to replace them abroad, a great lesson learned, so it was not a total loss.  

BA used to be a great airline, but these days they gouge you for every little thing after buying your tickets and their legendary British customer service has deteriorated, making us feel unwelcome and unappreciated. We will stick with United or Lufthansa for our twice annual European flights from now on and I doubt BA cares in the least ... ADIOS!

327|"Ahh, Yea! British Airways did not disappoint! It was a legit comfortable flight, to say the least!

My last trip of the year and my butt went to Italy, baybee! Yesss!!!

:: The Crowd Goes Crazy!!::

I found me a steller deal for less than $380 a couple of months before the trip and didn't hesitate to purchase. Ya' girl is cheap, so I booked the economy without selecting my seat and didn't think twice. A day before the flight, I checked in and paid for my luggage. I had a layover in London, and it was a perfect amount of time to use the bathroom, eat and relax before we connected to Rome.

+The seats were comfortable for it to be economy!
+The flight attendants do a fantastic job of checking in.
+ The flight that we took headed to Rome had outlets to charge our phone, which was pretty sweet!
+ The TV's on the headrest were a great size!
+The food was pretty decent AND they give complimentary wine! Baybee, even two if you're like me and don't mind asking for seconds! HA
+I didn't have to wait long for my bags to arrive at the baggage claim.
+No delays! Bingo

For the price I paid to fly all away across the US and overseas, British Airways is an airline I would ALWAYS fly again and again. You can find some great deals on this airline. British Airways, I will be flying high in the sky with you again VERY soon!"|british-airways
328|"I would give them zero if possible but then I remembered they got us to our destination in one piece.
To start, the flight was booked as a full fare business class seating round trip to Amsterdam from Miami through Heathrow. 747 with upper level. Thought it would be quieter and more exclusive. It was a baby zoo upstairs. British parents don't seem to care that they don't buy their children/babies tickets but lap them for a 10 hour flight. Child Abuse! They let their babies scream and the flight attendants arw so old that they don't have the energy to make children more comfortable. The upper deck is also very noisy. Our giraffe sized flight attendant with her elephant shoes stomped up and down the aisle so much that it vibrated from noise and made it impossible to sleep on the overnight flight. The seating configuration was terrible. The widow seats were totally blocked in by the aisle seat which happened to face the opposite direction so the person in the window stared right into the face of the stranger sitting in the aisle. If you needed out of the window seat, you had to straddle the reclining legs of the person in the aisle. Totally ridiculous. The service was unfriendly and not very hospitable.
Landed in Heathrow and did not enjoy the process of changing planes. 20 minute bus ride whipping around corners at 35 miles per hour as the driver slammed on the brakes to the bus going from terminal 3 to 5. Then once off bus, back though security which took an hour with fast track. Not British Airways fault but too short of connection times for as many people as they has to process. From Heathrow to Amsterdam still had business class fare but they only use small planes for this route. Will never do that again. The plane was 737 sized with no ""real"" 1st class. Picture a Southwest plane with the center seat with a permanent tray table in the middle seat. No extra leg room and the window seat person had to climb over the tray table to squish into the coach class sized seat. The service was even worse on this flight. The flight attendants would not explain the breakfast food choice and pretty much slapped the hot plates onto your lap and moved along. How rude! I noticed that they were very unfriendly to the Americans but the British people got much better service. Mark my words....I will never fly British Airways again and I hope to avoid changing planes in Heathrow if at all possible. What a waste of a few thousand dollars on my travel for sub standard accommodations."|british-airways
329|"We actually flew with British Airways on 3 separate occasions on our recent trip to London and Dublin. There was one 11 hour long haul flight and 2 short 1 hour flights.

(+) the seats were actually fairly comfortable. They were definitely more comfortable than they first appeared! For the first time EVER, I slept roughly 7 hours of my almost 11 hours on the plane!
(+) staff was very nice and friendly

(-) the TV's on the back of the headrests were smaller than average and older. the picture quality was terrible and the selection of viewing options very limited. A bit of a disappointment when starting a long haul flight.
(-) Even using the sliding scale of airplane, inflight food this was pretty terrible. I'm not expecting gourmet stuff here, but yikes. I pretty much just stuck to the drinks and chips and crackers.
(-) all 3 planes we flew on were older and beat up

British Airways wasn't terrible, but I had heard really good things about them before this and was a bit let down. I've flown better and I've flown worse, so if the price is good enough I would fly with them again.

3 stars.

A-Ok."|british-airways
330|The flight from San Jose to London was a very easy one.  It was delayed a bit over an hour but the service was great.  Once we took off (close to 10pm) they served dinner and I had the filet of beef - looked nice but was not good - even for airplane food.  I decided to pass on anything else and sleep the rest of the flight.  Business class is nice but the layout where you face one another is awkward!  It's also a little difficult to get seated if you're seated in a window seat.|british-airways
331|"I'm a Lufthansa girl.  I was born in Germany and when I travel back and forth between my home now in the States and Munich, of course I am going to chose Lufthansa.
That said, British Airways is another one of my preferred carriers when I am flying international.  The ground and flight crew have always been friendly and respectful.  On long-haul flights very few airlines compare with BA in their first class section.
Cabins have always been clean, world-class service that are spacious, comfortable and quiet.  I'll keep booking with BA when possible!"|british-airways
332|"They lose one star for their chaotic boarding process, but redeem themselves later on for my return flight.

TWIN SEATS ON THE DOUBLE DECKER BUS
My boyfriend and I snagged some really great roundtrip flights to London Heathrow for less than $450 in October and we were stoked to fly on British Airways because it was a double decker plane. We decided to invest in the twin seats on the second level because we read reviews that it would be much quieter upstairs and we didn't want to take our chances with a crazy seat neighbor or the typical crying baby. I HIGHLY recommend snagging the twin seats if you have the opportunity to do so. You may get lucky if you check in on the day of your flight and it's still available to select, but it is well worth the investment. It's more private and I am told there is slightly more leg room here.

BOARDING PROCESS
We flew out of LAX and were very disappointed by the boarding process. When it came time to board, there seemed to be next to no organization and people kept crowding the tunnel just to make their way to their seat. Luckily it was assigned seating because I would have been so frustrated by people's inability to follow directions and maintain a single file line.

FLIGHT AMENITIES & EXPERIENCE
The flight to London itself was very comfortable and I knocked out the entire way there except for breakfast, which I always ask to be woken up for, hehe. We loved taking advantage of the complimentary alcohol such as wine and beer as it helped us knock out like a baby! The flight attendants were all very sweet and helpful as well. They certainly made us feel like we were well taken care of.

PREMIUM ECONOMY SEATS
We had an unfortunate encounter with one of the guests sitting in front of us on our flight back home to Los Angeles, wherein she was intentionally making life difficult for my 6'1"" boyfriend in the economy seat. Since she started cussing him out in front of everyone, the flight attendants took it upon themselves to rectify the situation and graciously upgraded us to the premium economy seats that also featured a 2-4-2 configuration... so we got a complimentary upgrade on better quality flights. Truly exceptional service and I am confident that BA knows how to take care of their guests!

The amenities in Premium Economy will be slightly better than Economy and the seats are also larger with significantly more leg room... they definitely thought of my boyfriend when they found another place for us to sit! You will still get the complimentary alcoholic beverages but I found that the attendants in this cabin were a lot friendlier (which says a lot since they're already very sweet to begin with).

--
Overall, I absolutely loved my experience with BA and would highly recommend flying with them again. The value of the flight along with the quality of the food, seat, and overall comfort definitely justify the cheap cost of the ticket.

333|"This is a horrible experience and I am paying a lot of money for it.  A business class ticket gets you very little.  

I bought this ticket through American Airlines and it is a code share fulfilled by British Airways.  If you do this (which I strongly advise you not to do) be aware that:

- you will not be able to select a seat until
shortly before you fly.  (I am sitting next to a stranger (although she is nice enough) and away from my traveling companion.  Not good.

- you will be given access to the BA Lounge, which is jam-packed with people.  It's hard to find a seat in there and everyone's luggage is everywhere.  Awful.  

- you will be part of a big cattle call which is probably what you want to avoid by purchasing this ticket.  Get in line and be there for a long time.

The BA people are very polite but it makes no difference to the horrible passenger process."|british-airways
334|"4.5 Stars.

I have not flown British Airways for probably 10 years ( back than it was a good experience as well).

I seriously do not understand all the gripes and grievances; yes airlines and airports have issues as it is a complex system.

Asking my friend from London if I should fly B A over they gasped and told me of the horrors of poor meals, indifferent service, and shoddy baggage and arrival/depatures....Gasp....I had already made my plane reservations.

Our experience was pretty great: From the lounges, to the seats, to the service, the meals, and the schedules: All was pretty flawless.

Caveat: we flew business class and it is a different feel than coach.

Lounges: SFO, Heathrow, and Ediburgh were all lovely places to relax. Food and drink were fine not fantastic. Service was friendly. WiFi was abundant.

Flights: Every single flight was pretty much on time (except Edinburgh to Heathrow which was delayed 45 minutes). The 747 and A380 planes business class seats (they are pretty much lie flat but you face another passenger luxurytraveldiary.com/wp…  ...great if you're traveling with someone) are very good but not great ( SAS, Emirates, Qatar, and Cathay are much better). I really really dislike that they charge for making a seat assignment ....that is pure rubbish. Entertainment is fantastic with plenty of brand new movies, music and Tele shows.

Food: Food was pretty good. It is not as good as many others but it has improved greatly. I had lox appetizers that were awesome, beef entrees that were good, and a duck confit that was fine. Booze and wine is good not great...but all selections were tasty. Good champagnes.

Tip: try to reserve your seats on the second level as it is much more private, service is almost concierge like, and the loos  are always available and clean.

Service: Some of the crew were absolutely fantastic while others were merely doing their duty. But I never had a bad experience.

In Summation I think Brittish Airways is upgrading many of their planes, food, and service and think it a good choice to travel abroad!!!"|british-airways
335|"British Airways is one of my favorite airlines. The thing I like about BA is they don't muck around with their pricing. Their airfares may not be the cheapest, but they are always stable and reliable. Some airlines change their rates depending on the wind direction.

The staff that work for BA are spectacular. As a Brit living in the US, it's always refreshing to be greeted with a fresh British accent as I board one of their aircraft's.

The food on-board is also tasty, the English black tea they serve is delicious.

BA, I will be flying with you again soon!"|british-airways
336|"British airways club Europe( business class) from Nice to London Heathrow isn't different from any other European business class
The seats are the same as economy but they block the middle seat so you don't feel as cramped
We had exit seats so extra room
The only real difference not that it is crucial on a 2hour trip is that serve a relatively decent light meal
We had the choice between cold cuts or goat cheese salad . The latter was tasty ; there was a small chicken curry salad and some crumble with cream
The champagne was not good
The flight left on time and landed on time and the crew was nice
I would not pay extra to fly business in Europe as it is not worth it ; most flights are under 2 hours
But you get the business class thrown in as we did if you book business over the ocean from the states to Europe ( for the flat beds )
Over all good experience with BA. Club europe"|british-airways
337|"London Heathrow to Venice BA 578 - Business Class

This was our first time flying in an Airbus A321 Club Europe Business Class. We were so glad that we did not pay for this class, as we used frequent flyer miles.  The so-called Business Class is a 3-seat configuration with the center seat blocked with a tray table bolted across the arm rests.  We did like the tray for placing a drink, etc. However, it was very hard to get in and out of the window seat due to the bolted tray.  The legroom is identical to Economy Class so it's a bit tight and the seats were not that comfortable.  Since we cannot remember anything about the flight, it must have been uneventful and the food service was just okay - nothing exciting.  

Our major hiccup came upon arrival in Venice.   There was a bit of a mix-up when we arrived in Venice.  British Airways did not explain to us how we were to connect with the person who would be helping me with a wheelchair.  We disembarked out on the tarmac and took a bus to the terminal.  My husband saw an empty wheelchair and put me in it. At one point, a young lady came and asked what we were doing. We explained that we had requested the wheelchair but it was not at the plane for me; so, we just took the first one we saw. Our luck changed when Matteo Baroni came along to push my wheelchair.  What a delight - he was so welcoming and accommodating.  He whisked us thru customs, retrieved our luggage and helped us with the tickets for the bus into Venice.  He made our arrival smooth and easy.

London Heathrow to Philadelphia BA 67 -  First Class

As we were flying First Class, we were impressed with the ease of checking in and boarding for our flight back to the US.  Again, we were accompanied to our seats by a crew member.  As I have already reviewed the same plane on our trip over, I will not repeat myself here.  

Our lunch service was as good as our dinner service on the flight over.  This time, we enjoyed warm truffle linguine, seared scallops with asparagus, seared filet of Aberdeen Angus beef, cheese plate, a selection of biscuits and Hotel Chocolat.  It was all beautifully prepared and presented - real dining!  

The best was the Afternoon Tea just before landing.  We were presented with a selection of sandwiches, which were just okay.  What was really the highlight were the scones with clotted cream and strawberry preserve.  Oh my, they were so delicious.  Of course, we enjoyed English tea.  All in all, it was a pleasant flight.  Our compliments to the pilots and crew!"|british-airways
338|British Airways are the only airline not working with customers that have had flights directly impacted by the Coronavirus. Not only are they not being understanding of the situation, they are still charging their hefty change/penalty fees on all existing tickets. Making money off of a global epidemic that has taken lives is disgusting behavior. What a heartless, greedy company.|british-airways
339|"Putting up with the BS of BA
Arriving to our early morning flight out of Gatwick, the cold-faced lady taking our luggage said we are late. Missed by 2 minutes. Huh? Actually we were checking our bags at 5:40am for a 6:25 flight.  She ""called"" someone and then said we can't board.
Geese!
Poor communication by BA. No express service should one be on the fringe of meeting your connection.
So glad to be done with BA for ALL future flights. We'll go to Europe but not with BA not through England! BA sucks!"|british-airways
340|"This was my first time flying w. British Airways from Heathrow, terminal 5. The check in and ticketing booth was OK to deal with customer service wise.

Like many flights off Heathrow, you get the info re. the Gate # too close to boarding time. The plane was small, old, outdated. They're partners with American Airlines and they remind me so much of this US airline and that's not a compliment. Yes, they do take you from A to Z and that's about it.  We also got stuck in Group 4 and they had to check in our carry on luggage which I'm not a fan of, especially when you respect the airline's policies. On the way back I didn't give in since I was just changing planes in London, so we brought the carry on-s in after some heated discussion, taking a chance. It was OK.

The plane was dirty inside, my husband's tray looked like somebody changed their baby's diaper on it. We asked a flight attendant to come and clean it, during the 3 hour flight, that never happened! But one of them did bump so much into my husband's seat that woke him up!

Maybe it's worse than American Airlines! During the 3 hour international flight they didn't bring it any snacks, any drinks or at least water! Sure, if you pay, they give you a few crappy options, that's about it. As the flight attendants say it w. their cute British accents :""Food available for purchase"".
So get some food in Heathrow or wherever else you board!

Not impressed w. this airline. Even animals in a Zoo get food and water! But not travelers on a 3 hour British Airways International flight!"|british-airways
341|"This is probably one of my favorite non-US airlines that I have experienced. After having a poor experience with their partner airline a week before with a long flight, I was nervous that I would have the same thing happen on my way back home.

  The coach seats are very comfortable, and lean back far enough so you don't have to feel stiff. They have great in-flight entertainment. The TV shows and music isn't that great but they had a lot of popular movies, so that kept me busy for the 7 hours on the plane.

 One thing that really stuck out to me was how much food was offered to us! It seemed like every couple hours they would hand us something else. We got two meals, and three different snacks! The meals came with so much too that I couldn't even eat all of it. The flight crew were all very friendly as well throughout the flight.

 Great option for the long-hauls!"|british-airways
342|I experienced some difficulty with my passport and was unable to fly as scheduled. The attendants were helpful and truly empathized with my situations I was very appreciative of them. They were also knowledgeable and friendly despite my issues they helped me remain calm.  Excellent experience.|british-airways

345|British Airways has become a low budget airline with flight attendants that just do not care about flyer comfort. Seat 39F in a March 2nd flight from Heathrow to JFK has a three inch knob which projects painfully into the side of my leg. Full flight in steerage but plenty of room forward, yet the attendants failed to do the right thing by moving me to a new seat forward.  In fact, the flight attendants' attitude was that they couldn't care less. What atrocious service!  BA has become the equivalent to a Wow Airlines or Ryan Air. My international business will now go to anyone BUT BA.|british-airways
346|"I have been stewing on this review since March and my rating has not changed since then.  My BA flight from Phoenix arrived 30 minutes late.  My flight was further delayed when they had to completely unload all the luggage form the plane and re-load causing an additional 30 minute delay.  We made up no time in the air form Phoenix to Heathrow (London).  We landed at Heathrow 1 hour later than scheduled and the plane had to sit on the tarmac for 30 minutes, causing a delay of 1.5 hours. We then had to line up to get on busses to get out of the terminal.  My flight to Brussles was gone.  So what did BA do?  Nothing.

I'm a AA Gold Member so that makes me a One World Ruby Member.  BA did not automatically book me on the next flight to Brussels.  I had to wait in line for an hour to speak to BA attendant that told me that the rest of the flights were full for the rest of the day.  He put me on standby and since no gate information could be provided, I had to ""hang out"" at the BA customer service area.  

A colleague of mine that I was supposed to meet in Brussels also missed his flight due to similar circumstances.  We hung out in the BA customer service area together.  He told me that he was also on standby and that he was not a One World or BA rewards member.  BA eventually announced a gate for the flight so we waited for available attendants.  I was helped by attended Ross.  The hold me ""you are confirmed for the flight so go to the gate and get your boarding pass.""  While on the train to the terminal my colleague also mentioned to me that he was also confirmed for the flight but I was puzzled when he showed me a boarding pass.  We arrived at the gate and checked in they told me ""you are not confirmed for this flight.""  WTF???  My colleague with no rewards status jumped on the flight to Brussels.  I had to back to where I came from to get booked on the first flight the next morning.

I went to recover my luggage, which was a 1.5 hour process.  They sent me to a specific carousel to which my luggage never arrived.  I went to desk to ask what was going on and got the run around.  They had sent me to the wrong carousel.  I finally got my luggage and my hotel and shuttle vouchers.  I had to spend the night in London and get 3 hours sleep to get the first flight out.  I was very disappointed with 1) They didn't automatically book me on the next flight 2) Agent Ross gave me incorrect information OR didn't give me a boarding pass and 3) They gave me the run-around with my luggage.

I will do whatever I can in the future to avoid this airline."|british-airways
347|"Garbage airline!!   Flew the ""new"" LHR to Nashville nonstop flight.  Horrible aircraft, must be the oldest I. The fleet.  Onboard entertainment system is lame, horrible movies, old TV programs, poor audio, etc..

The worst is the food!!   They ""ran out"" of one dish, told us all they had was some nasty chicken, red sauce and potatoes.  Who makes this crap??!!  Asked for a simple soda three times.  Then for ""lunch"" we got a smoked salmon with cucumber sandwich.  Not everyone eats fish!  No options, tasted AWFUL.

If you're going to overcharge your customers at least make sure the aircraft is large, clean and has plenty of food.

Will never fly this garbage carrier again.  Their greed to expand to American cities is disgusting."|british-airways
348|This is my third time flying BA. First time was a long haul from London to Los Angeles and the plane was old and uncomfortable. This time we flew from London Heathrow to Vienna Austria. The plane was an A380 used for short flights and there is a reason its used for short flights.....its very uncomfortable!!! The seats are thin and hard with minimum cushion and the headrest puts your head forward to much. No USB ports no movies to watch etc. No complimentary soft drinks/snacks onboard. They accept credit cards and debit cards (no cash!) for drinks and food which is annoying to have to charge a drink on your card. Know some credit cards don't work like Bank of America with a chip as well as Bank of America's debit cards so it has to be done manually on the ground. The reason given was  the bank doesn't approve charges in the air for fraud purposes. BTW you must try a drink called Pinkster yum!!!.   I have always found flight attendants and employees of BA really nice.|british-airways
349|"My daughter ordered a wheelchair since she is not supposed to walk long distances due to a disability, but British Airways did not have one available (despite calls and emails to make sure everything was set). She had a 2 hour layover to hop to the next plane, but they gave the ONE wheelchair to an elderly gal who had an 8 hour layover, leaving my daughter crying and having to walk. The employees talked about how she ""seemed"" fine and should be able to walk, enough to where she could overhear their conversation. Apparently people with unseen disabilities such as cancer, diabetes, lupus, gastroparesis, Krohns and other diseases must fly other airlines. Who do I call to make these people accountable? This is SOOOO unacceptable. I'm ready to go on a rampage against them. I wish she had a video of the incident so it would go viral. GRRRRR!"|british-airways
350|"Good stuff.

Spacious seats, employees were friendly enough, blankets and pillows on each seat, smooth flight, friendly/informative pilot, clean restrooms that smell nice, meals/drinks provided. Best part, the plane didn't have that ""plane smell"" to it that makes me feel super nauseous on most flights. They either have great ventilation or use some sort of air freshener.

Overall, I'm super satisfied with British Airways."|british-airways
351|This is a horrible airline, they don't care about their customers at all. Representatives on the phone are trained to push customers away and never put a manger on the phone. I've tried to cancel my flight for weeks due to the healthy safety hazard of coronavirus. I've called their customer service line multiple different times, waiting over an hour to get a representative on the phone and each time I asked to speak to a supervisor regarding my matter. Every time, the representative said no. One time, the representative told a manger that I was very unhappy with the airline, and after the asking their manager, they were told that the manger would not speak to me. I asked to make a complaint with their customer relations department, and I was told to make a complaint online and that there was nobody I could talk to about it. Multiple representatives talked over me, tried to push me off the phone, and showed no empathy or appreciation for my business. Countless times has this airline showed me that I don't mean anything to them, except a dollar sign. Building relationships and loyalty is not apart of this company's mission, rather it's to maximize one time transactions. I've never felt so frustrated and taken an advantage of by a company. The strongest voice that a consumer has is with their money, and British Airways will never see my business again. I recommend that everybody stays away from this airline, and pay extra if you have to book a flight with another airline because British Airways is nothing but a headache.|british-airways
352|"On our most recent transatlantic flight, I thought the meal times were odd on British Airways; dinner is served within an hour of getting on the flight (had I known I wouldn't have eaten at sfo) & then breakfast is served 45 minutes before landing (making it a bit of a rushed affair), but nothing in the middle. I'm always well equipped with snacks on flights (& in everyday life) so no hanger issues there. The meals were better spaced out on the flight back home.

Plenty of leg room in economy.

No USB outlet.

Recent movies to keep us occupied (Bridget Jones' Baby, Suicide Squad, Cafe Society, Secret Life of Pets.)

Lovely air hostesses.

Few pockets of turbulence. Landing was rough & sudden. Definitely jolted me awake. A fine fight, otherwise."|british-airways

we paid for upgrade seats , at the gate did not receive it

lost luggage, diversion, low level customer service with caveats to rid of customer requests"|british-airways
354|Vile. The workers in heathrow are disgustingly rude and obnoxious. **On board attendants are sweet tho! So give them credit.*** Anyway....while I understand them being totally disgruntled with their jobs bc that airline in that airport is a shit show, I don't appreciate the passive aggressive, snot nosed attitude they have towards the passengers. Won't be using that airline again. I'm sure they won't miss just mine and my family's money..but maybe if someone else reads this review they won't use them also.|british-airways
355|I have never flown British Airways before but was honestly quite pleasantly surprised. For my 2017 vacation, I took my usual United to Japan, but the meal was truly horrible in economy class. For British Airways, the food is quite decent in comparison to other airlines in 2018. I had curry with rice, bread, smooth chocolate mousse, and salad with vinaigrette dressing. Everything tasted wonderful. The seat is also much bigger than United's with plenty of stretching area. The movie screens are more updated and clear (not broken like some United's). Overall, I have to say this airline does deserve a seat in the top 10 based on the latest ranking of airlines. Needless to say, we arrived at London without issue but with slight delay of 20 minutes. Overall, I would say the trip was great on British Airways and highly recommend.|british-airways
356|"We took British Airways on our trip home from Spain in two legs: BCN-LHR and LHR-SFO.  The last time I flew them was like 15 years ago on a business-class trip for work. I remember being greeted with a handshake by the attendant upon boarding.  He looked a lot like Senator John McCain!  The food, service, and movie system was great back then.

Fast forward to the present on an ECONOMY class ticket on BA on their 747-700 and the service and food were excellent on the LHR-SFO leg!  The flight attendants were chipper and friendly and acted like they enjoyed serving us.  The video system actually worked smoothly with lots of choice of movies and TV.  Plenty of leg room and elbow room.

Food was surprisingly good for Economy Class. Dinner was the national dish of Britain - Chicken Curry over Rice (not Fish and Chips anymore).  Chicken was actually tender and juicy and not dry.  They even thew in a tiny bottle of white wine.

For lunch they offered a chicken casserole that was also creamy and flavorful.  It came with an amazing chocolate mouse for dessert!

I may want to seriously consider using BA instead of United for a future trip to say, London."|british-airways
357|"I currently fly to South Africa twice a year from San Diego  on business, and I have done so for the last 10 years. I first started flying with Delta and then switched over the last  4 years British Airways, joining their mileage program and started looking forward to some of the benefits that come with moving up there tier levels. 2 years ago I made it to the bronze and started receiving some of the benefits which was which were pretty nice.

But when travel schedule change by a week to South Africa, I found out that I had lost my status a week before my schedule travel.

Very disappointing especially thinking that I now have to wait another couple years before I get to that to level again. I think it's time to fly Delta, and their rewards program.

I'm very disappointed in the national traveller!"|british-airways
358|"BA0057 on 3/23/18.  Rude, discriminatory, horrible inflight customer service. Flight attendant ""manager,"" heavier white female in early 30s, kicked me out of my seat last minute for no reason.

Flight attendant ripped up my boarding pass (aisle seat which I selected and paid for) and issued me a middle seat next to screaming babies. Unheard of.
Even passengers around me were riled up, confused, and apologized to me.

It was my first time flying British Air, so I don't have status. But it doesn't give the right for the airline to treat you like dirt.

I've been to 20+ countries, fly multiple times each year, and never had this shitty of an experience.

I understand that the flight attendant doesn't represent BA as a whole though my first leg was terrible (attendant never offered me a beverage, only offered to the man next to me).  

I've sent a complaint through the website which will not result in anything substantial."|british-airways
359|"we booked our tickets through American airlines which put us on a flight from Dubai with British airways,  we were sitting in business class and when we called for our seats together (we are both 76) and have never not sit together in all our years.  we were told that we had to pay for our seats or we may not sit next to each other. I could not believe this, we have paid extra for exit row seats or economy plus but NEVER to sit together in business class, we had to cancel our trip due to medical reasons and when I wrote to them and sent doctors letters, they would not refund our 446.00 we paid for them. I called 3 times and got a run around from them.  D""ONT travel with them unless you have to take their flights and most of all if you paid for seats forget about a refund."|british-airways
360|My wife and I were forced to take a British Airways connecting flight (original flight was on American) from London to Milan on 9/6/19. We were shocked when their refreshment cart came down the aisle during the flight and we learned that we could not even get a cup of water for free but we would have to purchase a bottle of water! Yes, we were coach passengers, but come on BA!! I never would have believed that any airline (especially a major size one like British Airways) would stoop to such a low level of service!! Plus their operation at the London Heathrow Airport was horrible in terms of posting almost all of their flight gates just 15-20 minutes before their departure time! I asked several staff if there was some sort of unusual problem happening that day and they said no, this was just the way things are there! Also, we had to go through at least three layers of security checks at LHR airport. One check point guy was especially obnoxious asking me a US sports question (since I am a US citizen) I was pretty sure he had little or no idea what he was talking about. He asked me what some of my hobbies were and I said sports, then he asked me who some of my favorite basketball players are. I was very tempted to say Babe Ruth to see what he would say, but I did not want to risk missing my flight and mess up our Europe trip. Wow, I hope we never have to fly British Airways again anywhere or anytime.|british-airways
361|"Not sure what all the hate is about. We were on British Airways from Los Angeles nonstop to London, and then from London nonstop to San Diego.

The flight out was a dream. We had a red-eye, so my goal was to sleep 8 of the 10 hours, so that I wouldn't go stir crazy.

The jet we were on was nice - it was a double-decker (is that the right term for a plane?), it was new, and it was cushy. We had a two-seater on the port side of the plane (do you use ""port"" when talking about a plane?), so it was comfortable for us.

Everyone working the flight was friendly and accommodating. They made sure we were settled when we got in, then continued to check on us throughout the night. Our dinner (cottage pie) was served an hour or so after we took off. It was decent, for an in-flight meal. They offered coffee, tea, wine and spirits, along with sodas and water to complement your meal.

Once everyone was done eating, they lowered the lights, and we all settled in to try to sleep. The hum of the engines provided the perfect white noise to help drown out the soft conversations around us, the guy snoring behind me, and the lady working on her laptop late into the flight.

Before I knew it, they were turning the cabin lights on again, to serve us breakfast - a croissant, granola bar and accompaniments. I wasn't hungry at that point, but my husband ate his and said it was good.

Our flight from Prague to London was packed but smooth - and they fed us on that leg, too. Our choices were a sandwich or a pesto salad. I chose salad, my husband chose the sandwich. They were decent - again, plane food.

The London to San Diego leg was a bit rougher - the plane was smaller and older, and it was during the day, so we were awake for the entirety of the flight. The flight crew was just as friendly and funny, which did help make the time go by a bit faster, but it was rough.

Dinner this time around was chicken tikka masala, which was surprisingly good. It was a full meal - from salad to main to dessert, and I enjoyed it. Heck, it was worlds better than the last meal we had in Prague. My husband went with the pesto pasta, and he enjoyed that as well.

Our final meal on the plane was afternoon tea, which delighted me to no end. The tea sandwich (egg salad) was good, and the scone with clotted cream and jam gave a nice sweet option.

Again, everybody we encountered was friendly, and they didn't yell at us when we got up to do laps up and down the aisles (long flight, man...it was needed!)

I'm very glad we ended up with British Airways for our first trip to Europe. Their service was on point, and the flights were smooth and got us in to each port ahead of schedule. Can't ask for much more than that."|british-airways
362|"Not expecting much when I first booked a round trip flight from LAX to LHR for $800 per person on the WT class.

But amazing service and exceeded my expectations on both crossings.

Crew was very professional and the crew leader / supervisor was amazing handling all the requests by passengers.

Meals were above average and very tasty - the British are into ""pies"" where shepherds pies of beef, fish or chicken were common....

Free soft drinks, English tea, coffee, and alcohol anytime you want made the time slip away.

Free snacks - just walk up to the galley area and ask - they have English tea scones, cookies, dried fruit, granola, and candy.

Was treated quite well on both ways but I forgot to upgrade to the WT+  for $165 each ticket on the way over which made for a cramped seating.  But on the way back, it was worth the extra expense for much more legroom, more meals, and better drinks!

The only thing I missed was WiFi but then 10 hours isn't that bad playing Angry birds or Candy crush...

Their movie and TV selections were great and made the time pass quickly.

Their newer 380-800 dual decker plane was the quietest I have ever been on!

Definitely will be using BA again!

Even signed up for their BA Executive Club membership Visa card which will now allow a companion to travel free next time I book a flight!"|british-airways
363|This was the most ridiculous BS experience I've ever had!!!! I have been checking flight prices from Los Angeles to Edinburgh for months. Yesterday, the flight prices were super low when I checked them in the afternoon. After making sure every one else in my group was good to go with purchasing now, I went back online using a different computer to book the flights. The tickets were the exact same price. By the time I got to the end of the booking process and put in my info to pay for the tickets, I got an error message to call British Airways. It was 9pm PST and they were closed. I called first thing this morning and they told me that price is no longer available?!?!?! I demanded to speak to a manager and he tried to say that their prices can change even when you've been given a price and you are in the booking process!!!! HOW IS THIS OK?????? This is bull$hit!!!!!|british-airways
364|"We traveled to Spain in Spetember, 2015.
Had no problems going to Spain, but coming back is another story.
Catching our return flight back to AZ, I had booked our return flight to go through Heathrow. BIG mistake.
Boarding our flight in Barcelona, the ticket agent had let on a passenger and didn't take their ticket. The head count was off. OMG. We sat in the plane for 3 hours; First it was the ticket agent; Secondly, we missed the window for taking off and had to wait to have the airline submit a new flight plan; Lastly, we ended have to fly 30 minutes out of the normal flight plan because France would not let our plane cross it's border. GIVE ME A BREAK.

So now we missed our connecting flight in London and had to wait in line to book a flight from London to Phoenix and the next one was the next day. So they booked us on a flight to Los Angeles and then to Phoenix. We left Heathrow and arrived in Los Angeles at 10:00 PM missing our connecting flight at 9:25 PM.

We were given a food voucher and had to stay overnight at a hotel, But what good was the food voucher? Everything was closed after 10 PM. All that was left was Vending Machines. To top it off, our flight was scheduled to leave from LAX at 7:30 AM which means we had to get up at 4:30 AM to catch the shuttle to the airport at 5:30 AM.

When we arrived in Phoenix, we had to track down out luggage. My wife's was there and mine was no where to be found. The next day, my luggage arrived at home and someone in either Heathrow or Phoenix had gone through and taken some of our souvenirs.

Next time, it will be a direct flight from Barcelona to USA."|british-airways

367|"This is a review of British Airlines policies during the Corona virus..... I made a reservation months ago (LA to Tel Aviv) on BA booking through Amex and using points to pay. I purchased trip insurance for an additional $383. With many tourist sites now closed and with an infection on my leg from a removed cancerous mole, I began calling Amex yesterday to cancel. My husband and I spent hours on hold. We gave our phone number and received return calls in 5 hours. We were told to call Brit. Air. We did...no one answered for hours. The website stated that tickets purchased on Amex could not be changed or cancelled on BA. We called Amex again....hours later...we were able to cancel. I tried to register my doctor's letter (should not fly) on Amex Assurance site. Impossible. Not set up to take new claims. Tried calling at 5:30 AM Pacific...when they had just opened. No answer..on hold for 45 minutes/gave up. No option for their calling back. Will have to ""snail"" mail my documents since no way to upload, despite their instructions. Am waiting for Amex to send me a customer survey! British Air is one of the only airlines NOT to accommodate those affected by corona virus/health conditions. Sad"|british-airways
368|"The worst. Lost bags and after two days in London we still don't have them. When you call to ask about them the call is answered by a BA rep in India. I'm in London and can't even speak to BA local. The rep in India had no idea where the bags were. This after being in London for 36 hours. Their website tracking was terrible also with no info regarding the luggage. Instead of enjoying the city all plans were cancelled, including a reservation at Gordon Ramsey's restaurant, so we could go shopping for clothes and a suitcase for the 10 day cruise out of South Hampton. I am so frustrated with their lack of giving a damn and having to cancel my plans to make up for their complete incompetence.
THEY REALLY DON'T CARE!!!!!
They are terrible and don't care!!
Did some checking and this is very common for the airline.
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED FLY ANY AIRLINE EXCEPT BRITISH AIRLINES!! They don't deserve any stars but to post this I have to give them one."|british-airways
369|"Really hating British Airways right now!! I understand wanting to beef up security at the last minute... BUT making people go through extra customs procedures when they have a connecting flight, then NOT rebooking them even though those extra procedures caused those people to miss their flights?!?! People are just stranded?!?!? Seriously!!?!  

If I can help it, I won't be flying with British Airways anytime soon!!! Customer service at its absolute worst!!! Major fail!"|british-airways
370|"Lesley rocks at British Airways!

She is definitely our family's hero. My husband was traveling overseas from deployment on emergency leave, mother is in critical condition. All he wanted was to get home and see his sick mom. Lesley was able to find him a flight that was leaving soon! She was kind and at such a busy airport that is a rare find. There's all this bad talk about airline employees on the media, but you never see random acts of kindness on twitter or Facebook. The universe must pay it forward to her! Thank you!"|british-airways
371|I was impressed that the flight was non- stop. I was not impressed with how tightly squeezes we were in  the seats. No leg room. And I saw a roach climb the wall. Not waiting to return home on this airline.|british-airways
372|"I don't know why I bother with this airline, despite having risen through the loyalty tiers over the last 15 years they never fail to let me down.

A recent long haul business trip in First was a laughingstock, no pyjamas, food offering beyond poor, cabin crew who ramped the heat up so you would fall asleep (didn't work by the way, we all complained we couldn't breath)

I know, first world problems but if your paying for a service you should expect to get it, BA hang their hat on being the best, faaaaaaar from it, BA management should fly Etihad, Emirates, Singapore or Cathay Pacific if they want to see how it's done"|british-airways
373|They need a major make over. They also need a staff makeover - the local gentry they hire is very complex and there was an overall dark appearance.   Furthermore randomly selecting white people for additional security checks is pointless.|british-airways
374|"British Airways feels like 2 different organizations depending on the departments/groups that you interact with.

Pros:
In-flight crew - Our World Traveler and Club World experiences had staff constantly asking if there was anything else we needed and did their best to satisfy each of our requests.

Galleries lounge - Good way to escape the chaos of Terminal 5 as we enjoyed pre-flight beverages, variety of mid-afternoon finger foods, and chair massages for our party of 5.

Cons:
Call Center - To redeem the British Airways companion vouchers, we had to call into the call center. In the US, there are limited hours and 75% of the time, I encountered a busy signal. The times that I was able to enter the queue, the waits were more than 20 min to speak with an operator. Once I got through and they told me that I needed to complete additional steps online, they were patient enough to wait 3 min while I completed these tasks.

Airport check-in staff - In Atlanta, the airport staff (they were at check-in and also at the boarding gate) were misinformed telling us that there was no free alcohol in World Traveler/Economy across the Atlantic. I double checked with the onboard crew and glad I asked.

In-flight meals: Enjoyed several Jack (Daniels) & Coke, red wine. Food in Economy was bland as the bread was hard and the food wasn't seasoned well. In Club World, we enjoyed the beef entree as it had good flavor and could compete with a basic steakhouse.

Heathrow's Terminal 5 - see my review there as the Terminal leaves so much to be desired for a building that just opened in 2008."|british-airways
375|When you pay TOP dollar for a transatlantic flight it should not be delayed for hours and hours! They gave very little information other then mechanical problems. I had to switch buildings and take a train to only find out it is going to be even later. When I asked politely when are we really going to leave I got a very rude person. You costumer service is terrible too. Totally unacceptable !!!|british-airways
376|"Dear Madam or Sir,
I am appalled at the way I have been treated by your airline. It is unconscionable that you would treat any human being like this.
I was booked on a return flight - LHR-AMS-LHR. I flew the first leg and arrived in Amsterdam without any issues. While in Amsterdam I got violently ill, to the point that the hotel kindly rebooked my room to extend for a night and called a doctor on my behalf. I had my assistant call the airline and was informed that with a doctor's note it would not be a problem to rebook. This is a flat out lie!
I then emailed the doctors note to the appropriate email address. I then proceeded to call the airline the next day whilst on the way to the airport. I was feeling OK to travel, but not great. I was put on hold for OVER two hours, at international rates I might add. This is where my nightmare began. I was called a liar by your representative, who told me that as there is no verified proof of a doctor's note, not only could he not do anything for me, I would have to buy a full priced ticket. This is astonishing. I had the confirmation email of receipt of the doctor's note, but was told that the ticket would not be able to be rebooked until the doctor's note was confirmed which would take 7 - 10 days. So there I am stuck in Amsterdam, not feeling well, being called a liar and having to pay full fare for my ticket. I proceeded to try to book a ticket on your website, which would not allow me to buy a ticket, so I went to the counter at the Amsterdam airport and purchased a full fare ticket. I am now being told that as I did not wait for the ticket rebooking, that I am not due any compensation.
So to recap, it is clear the British Airways not only does not care about their passengers, but the airline is not equipped to handle anyone getting ill whilst flying your airline! I have now spent another two hours on the phone with various customer reps and supervisors who have kept me on hold, but also have been of no help whatsoever.
Noone should be treated the way that I was treated. Noone who is ill should have to suffer through what I did in Amsterdam. I am truly shocked at the treatment I have recieved and the way I have been treated by your airline. I am US based, a 1K member and a Million Miler on United. I fly a lot. I have been delayed, bumped, rebooked, missed flights, had to stay the night in connecting cities, and never in my entire life have I been mistreated so.
Yours in disgust and amazement,"|british-airways
377|"British Air people friendly, business friendly, I definitely think they ARE FAILING !!!

Flying Club World in one of their older 747 models upstairs, which is supposed to be quite ... but has numerous children crying and all passengers (except parents complaining).

No  warning, no protection and no separation ... being a father of three I certainly understand traveling with kids, but not at the jeopardy of business customers who only get the flight to test."|british-airways
378|"Sad to say this is the worst airline I have ever flown with. Not only were two of my flights delayed, seems like a trend according to other passengers but the staff, the staff make the experience all the more miserable. Not only do they look and talk down to you, they act like doing their job is torture to them. Not sure why all the employees, ground crew and air crew, act like this but no matter the location or flight I have had the worst interactions with BA employees.

Here's a helpful tip, if you don't like your job, or can't interact with your customers in a friendly and helpful manner, this isn't the job for you. And if you want an enjoyable flight, choose a different airline. I will never fly with BA again!"|british-airways
379|"British Airways has gradually become a budget airline for short haul European routes.  Similar to the established budget airlines Ryanair and Easyjet:

- they now charge a fee of £15 to change your seats that are automatically pre-allocated during online check in
- you need to board early in order to find space in the cabin to store hand luggage.  Otherwise you risk the inconvenience & delay of having your hand luggage stored in the hold.  Most people overpack hand luggage to avoid checked in luggage fees taking up the limited overhead luggage space on board
- they allow 2 pieces of hand luggage but so does Ryanair
- in flight meals are no longer served in Economy class; instead passengers are offered a choice of snack either a biscuit or packet of crisps

So now the only difference between British Airways and the budget airlines is usually a higher airfare for which you gain an in flight beverage and a biscuit or packet of crisps!  Oh and you can earn Avios points to collect towards another low budget flight!"|british-airways
380|"This is a review for Giles, the Customer Service Executive of British Airways at London Heathrow airport  that on March 14th, 2015 turned a very bad experience with my denied boarding on an Air New Zealand flight to a great customer service experience with my substitute flight British Airways.

I was supposed to fly VCE-LHR-LAX with  BA and ANZ.

When my connecting flight arrived at LHR, I was denied boarding by Air New Zealand because apparently I had not checked in, which I consider to be their lame excuse because I had an assigned seat and my luggage had already been checked in to LAX  before I boarded my connecting flight in VCE.

I was very upset but Giles went above and beyond to help me: he booked an hotel room for the night, arranged for my meals and transportation and re-booked me on a flight with BE the morning after.
He had very polite manners and it really felt like he cared.
This kind of service gained BA a very loyal customer from now on and I will definitely favor BA on all my next flights."|british-airways
381|"I had 4 flights with BA, flying Club World and Club Europe.  

Dallas to London:  I acquired an upper deck seat on this flight (had to pay an extra $100 to the lovely people at BA after already paying thousands for my ticket) and it was great.  Not too many people, the staff were excellent, bins on the side to store my carry on, it was a real joy.  Downsides: food was a little better than mediocre and the ""Club Kitchen"" was a joke - there was hardly anything in it.

London to Frankfurt: ""Club Europe"" is a complete ripoff.  It's the exact same seats as economy, 3x3, with a tray in the middle seat.  No leg room at all.  What a ripoff.

Frankfurt to London: ""Club Europe"" again.  If this is Business Class my name is Malcolm X.

London to Seattle: This is where it gets bad.  I was in Club World again, but this time I had an obese man on the other side of me who constantly moved like a hyperactive child, which moved the entire ""cubicle.""  Incredibly annoying.  I put my seat down to sleep and for once I actually managed to fall asleep on an airplane.  Only to be woken up by a very...  ""three dollar bill"" male flight attendant.  He woke me up to put my seat belt on.  The seat belt sign went off less than 1 minute after he so rudely disturbed me.

When we finally landed this fruit had the nerve to extend his arms and say ""I have to hold you back so First Class can leave first.""  Of course no one was doing this on the other side of the plane near the exit door, so I paid thousands to wait while Economy Class passengers started leaving.  I finally walked through his kidnapping attempt and left.  Maybe since it was ""Pride Month"" he felt ""empowered.""

We got to customs/immigration and literally 100+ bags came out on the conveyor before mine.  In America at least when you fly First they put a ""VIP"" tag on your bag to it is likely to come out early.

Overall not impressed with this airline for what I paid.  Not inclined to ever fly with them again."|british-airways
382|"Service with a smile, always cheerful staff, and they make travel so much fun for the children. If you're flying with a family, British airways will involve the children in every aspect of travel. It just makes traveling fun for them, when they get to go behind the counter, help check us in, and push the buttons to make the luggage belt move.....it makes their day of travel unforgettable. For the little ones it's a fascinating experience.

This airlines is one of our favorites because they have great customer service. From the counter to the inflight staff it's always enjoyable. Very attentive and engaging. I feel like a traitor to Virgin airlines because we love them too, but when it comes to flights to the UAE, this airline has you beat.

Be sure to always call to book your flight. There are travel perks and upgrades you just won't get online. Also, be sure to always ask for an upgrade or a pass to the lounge. If you're not a lounge member, no worries members of the military and other civil service groups can get a curiosity pass if they ask. But always ask, the worst they can say is no.

Great customer service is not dead, you just have to know what to ask for. And please always be polite, it will take you far with others....especially those in customer service. Cheers!!"|british-airways

385|I had the ultimate WORST experience with this airline than what I had ever had in my life. It's impossible to get a hold of them through the customer service line, they take forever to take your call and never resolve any issues. As that wasn't enough while flying from London to Phoenix I got to use their lounge at the Heathrow airport and was sexually harassed and disrespected by a group of guys. Even though I told them, took a picture of who they were and showed them nothing was done about it. As THAT wasn't enough they had to change airlines and randomly changed everyone's seats without letting anyone know. I had to seat 12 seats away from my husband even though with checked in before hand and chose the seats accordingly. As THAT wasn't enough when we tey to speak to VIKORIA, the attended by the boarding gate she was BEYOND rude and disrespectful. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL experience with them. I will pay $400// $500 more a flight if needed but I refuse to EVER fly this company again!!!|british-airways

390|"I've totally run out of gas. I was so exasperated for so long, now, I just cannot stay awake! First, I get to SFO at 1:11 to find out my 4:10 flight has been delayed to 6:40, but doesn't leave until 7:30. In SFO, they tell me, ""You should have plenty of time to get to your flight, sir"". LIARS!

I get on the flight and the lay-down seats don't really lay down properly to allow one to sleep! Plus, B/A runs everything like a boot camp. Even though I'm in Business Class, I couldn't leave my bag with me, tucked somewhere. Oh, that's not too bad. Waaaah! Then, no TV screen for a very long time. Even though I am Priority (fast clearance through customs/TSA/gates, etc.), nobody looked at my conflict and helped me (or anyone) get out of the plane faster as we had a tight connecting flight. United always does that! I should have flown UA.

On the plane, they keep apologizing for the delay. Even at SFO, they printed up flyers saying it was delayed, but never explained why.

So, I get off the plane and don't see my connecting flight in LON. Hmmm. I go to the B/A person and they say, ""11 minutes, sir, they've closed the doors, you've missed your flight, see my colleague over there (go away, you troublesome wretch!) who will help you re-schedule a flight"".

I get to the counter, and for the next 30 minutes, the counter-guy tries to put me on this and that flight, to no avail. I get a 15GBP voucher. I was already entitled to the lounge, but not the First Class Lounge. I am exhausted. I could barely sleep perhaps a half hour of interrupted uncomfortable squirming sleep by now. I have no underwear again (I better get my luggage!) until Delhi. I was originally supposed to go to Hyderabad directly, but now I have to go to Delhi, retrieve my baggage, go through customs, re-enter for domestic connecting flight to Hyderabad. This is really bad. Definitely one of my worst experiences. I will never fly B/A (Barely Acceptable) again!"|british-airways
391|"TERRIBLE!!!! We were flying roundtrip from London to Dublin and eventhough their website clearly states that they allow military to have checked bags free of charge, they insisted on charging for our 1 checked bag.  My husband had ID military ID and documentation and they still refused to honor their policy.  I have even tried to dispute it through our credit card company but BA continues to stand-by their charge.

And to top it off, they wouldn't even let us sit together, on our honeymoon, unless we paid another $50 EACH way.  Thanks for nothing BA, I wont be back again."|british-airways
392|"The customer service of British Airways is so poor at heathrow! I'm upset is an understatement! Adam is the duty manager and he doesn't have the time to speak to an unhappy customer in person!

Harj a very rude rep saw me talk on the phone for 2 hrs and implied and I'm lying and I never spoke to their customer service on the phone.

The issue is BA and American airline and issue the same ticket and the terminals are different! It is easily possible to mistake one for the other. With such poor service I will never fly British again!"|british-airways
393|"I love my nuts warm!

Okay, take a step back from my reference to how I believe nuts should be served, let's go through the rest of my review, starting off with how I was reminded of law school as I settled into my seat for my recent flight from Heathrow to Los Angeles.  

It was a little after I had just finished my first year when I formed the opinion:

    *If only everyone went through the first year of law school, they would truly know what they could accomplish and how far they can push themselves and achieve.*

My experience with British Airway (BA) First (""First"" as in first class), epitomizes *not* what someone *could* achieve, but what one could *expect* when one has ""arrived."" [1]

I believe that a steward has only one goal, and that is catering to the experience his/her passenger would like to achieve.  It may consist of being waited-on hand and foot, or being provided with complete privacy because even being asked ""Do you need anything?"" would equal an unwelcomed distraction from completing a critical argument in a legal brief, a passage in a soon-to-be best-selling novel, or a company-saving proposal.  Our (or should I say ""my"") steward, Roy, achieved the perfect balance during the flight from London to Los Angeles as part of a ""last-leg"" back from a cruise with my mom on Crystal Cruises in the Mediterranean.

He (and his fellow stewards Vicki and Beatriz) provided a seamless experience between (spoken with a proper British accent, of course) of:

""Is there anything else you need, sir?""

    to,

""You seem like you want to be left to your own thoughts and I will call upon you when requested, of course, but otherwise not disturb you.""

Forget about the fabulous cuisine, because that should be de rigor for any first class experience.  What truly sets someone who's lucky (or worthwhile) enough to experience BA First is their anticipation and service.  That's it.

When I become a millionaire (actually, a multi-millionaire, because a million just doesn't buy as much as it used to),  my goal will be to establish a foundation that will fly under-privileged, at-risk teens on BA First so they can experience what it means to have ""made it.""  My belief has always been that exposing someone to what they ""could be"" will inspire them to reach beyond what they know--or even what they think they know--could be, because I believe imagination is the most powerful force on the planet.

[1] Take it with a  grain of salt that I've only experienced one other First Class cabin, which was with China Airlines, but that was long enough ago (2010) that, given how far and fast air travel amenities has progressed, we may as well consider it as ancient history as when the Wright Brothers took to the air."|british-airways
394|Stranded in London for 3 full days from June 10-12 with no luggage thanks to an IT failure at BA.  Customer service was horrific and I never plan to travel on BA again.|british-airways
395|"I try to avoid BA due to their poor customer service in the air and on the ground, as well as customer support if anything ever goes wrong. However, there are cases where the alternatives are not feasible so I am forced to fly them more than I like.  This trip was no different - the issues I have had range from lost luggage, damaged luggage, cancelled flights, bad food, refusal of access to lounges (despite having the appropriate credentials)  etc.

I arrived at the Mumbai airport at 1230am and stood in line for 30 minutes (mind you this was the line for first and business class).  I eventually was told that the flight was delayed - by 24 hours.   We were supposed to have received emails and other notifications - yes, you guessed it: NOTHING was sent!!!!  I was told to come back the next day at the same time. I pleaded with the person at the counter for support to help me get back to the US due to a critical meeting I needed to attend.  He said every single seat out of Mumbai was sold.....  I appealed to his sense of decency and asked him to please make an effort. While I understand the instructions from BA are usually to not lose revenue by re-booking people on other airlines, the fact that I had a full fare flight and am the top tier traveler on the sister airline, should have some small bearing - the BA service and attitude is appalling.  The young man took pity on me and called several airlines finding me a solitary seat on Emirates...I thanked him profusely (it took 2 hours to arrange this) and offered some reward - he said no and simply asked for my good wishes and 'blessing' which I happily gave him and wished him good fortune and that the beautiful thing he did for me would be repaid to him in multiples.  I hope and wish it brings him good fortune.  

So, BA - shame on you.  You are not a customer service airline and you are not an airline I wish to be associated with.  However, I am forced to use you due to circumstances.  To those who can avoid this airline - do ourselves a favor and keep as far away from them as possible.  

I intend to write a complaint letter to BA and send as high as I can...but alas, I know that my letter will land up in the shredding bin."|british-airways
396|I wish I could give negative stars. Terrible, terrible, terrible. No plans, abysmal service, and honestly the worst flight experience I've ever had. Originally had a flight from London to Boston early in the morning. The plane, according to BA was downsized and therefore about 150 people lost their seats and scrambled to get on another flight. Personally, we were put on a flight that was supposed to fly at 19:55 but got delayed to 22:30 (at 8 in the morning we already knew it was delayed which was concerning). So, my family and I spent over 16 hours in an airport waiting as we got there at 8am and our flight kept getting delayed until midnight. At midnight, after those 16 hours, our flight was announced to be cancelled. We were then left stranded in another country, scrambling for a hotel and a new flight. This was a great stress on our whole family as you can imagine and I still don't even know how our actually flight home (which is supposed to be 2 days after our original flight) will go.|british-airways
397|"On the 14th of June 2004 I flew British Airways flight BA69 to Philadelphia (PHL) from London (LHR).
It was the 2nd flight of the day for this service to Philly so I caught the smaller aeroplane, a Boeing 777 and I honestly thought to myself 'Is this thing going to take me to America?' but sure enough it did. No horror stories, nothing like that, heightened security on all flights going to the US meant my bags had to be processed through some added screening; no bags lost, can't blame the airline for policies like that however I can say not one bag was lost, nothing was damaged and I guess I was as safe as I could be given everything how British Airways handled that, The legroom wasn't as much as US Airways, but British Airways still offered inflight entertainment and British Airways gave you a map to let you know where you were above in flight and how fast you were going.

My return flight was June the 28th 2004 British Airways flight BA66 to London (LHR) from Philadelphia (PHL) and, I got on the first flight of that day, a bigger Boeing 747, better for legroom too in World Traveler Class a.k.a Coach.
Got that day's news from the BBC recorded on my flight back to England which I watched over America and then I went home... Minor turbulence, made flight friends of those seated near me, got up to use the bathroom, night flight, saw me in London the next day."|british-airways
398|Absolutely atrocious. Trying to fly home the other day was an absolute nightmare. First thing was when we got up to the desk in Rome to hand over our checked bags they DEMANDED that we also check our carry on bags. I refused. Every customer is entitled one complimentary carry on. And for fear of them loosing my checked bag, I was not willing to give up my carry on bag that had back up clothing and toiletries in it. She gave me a dumbfounded look and then fumbled around to say that it was a full flight and we had to check our bags. This is what blows my mind. How are they going to fill up a flight and not have enough room for people's carry on bags? I had a standard roller wheel carry on bag that would have no problem fitting in the overhead bin and would not take up too much space. She made me put my bag in the area to check to see if it was too big. Mind you, I have traveled a ton with this bag and have never ever been questioned. It is standard size and is actually smaller then a lot of other ones I have seen. I immediately noticed their sizing model is too small and there is no way my bag would fit. Of course I have to check it now. Thoroughly pissed off, we walk through security to our gate. I then notice that everyone waiting has their carry on bags and are actually bigger then mine. Why were we picked out of the bunch? Because we are Americans? That entire day we felt like we were looked down upon and treated differently then everyone else. Flash forward to the actually flight from Rome to London. Sitting on the plane watching people fight and claw over overheard space was thoroughly entertaining. Again I ask, why even allow carry on bags if you can't accommodate them for everyone? After a longgggg boarding time and scrambling to find room for peoples bags, we had to wait on the tarmac for 45 minutes to take off due to a computer problem. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining about them taking the time to fix  what needed to be fixed before take off. My main complaint is that we had a connecting flight to catch that had only an hour layover that we were going to miss. The pilot and staff on board didn't say a word about what we needed to do. They didn't offer up any information until myself and the girls I was traveling with started panicking about how we were going to get home! This is outrageous. In the States, if there is a delay when taking off, they constantly keep you updated and let you know what is going on. Not on British Airways. In face when we asked the flight attendants, they seemed annoyed and disturbed by having to help us with this. We get in to Heathrow and were met by someone with a sign. They already had tickets ready for another flight 4 hours later and 10 dollar restaurant vouchers for the airport. How kind right? NOT !!! When we looked at the time the tickets were issue it said 8:10 a.m.  This means they had already bumped us to the next flight WITHOUT TELLING US while we were still sitting on the tarmac panicking in Rome!!!! OUTRAGEOUS. You think they let us know on the flight over to reassure us they had taken care of it? NOPE. Instead we were anxious and nervous for that entire flight over thinking we might not make it. When I went to complain to the customer service desk, they were rude and unhelpful. You know the flight we took four hours later? Also delayed by an hour. I am never taking this airline again and will be filing a formal complaint with them. DO NOT TAKE THIS AIRLINE. I also noticed from other reviews on here that the problems arose at Heathrow. I am with the other reviewers when I say Heathrow is the worst ever! This is where a lot of problems arose. If you can help it, don't fly into Heathrow for a connecting flight. It's a mess. Avoid at all costs.|british-airways
399|"We wanted to get on an earlier flight so we called in, they removed us from our seats to check availability. Despite the fares being roughly the same and plenty of seats on the earlier flight they wanted to charge us almost $400 to switch. Fine scratch that just give us our seats back please? Not possible, after 3 tries I was able to get a manager (Jess""LR"") who wouldn't give me her name. She told me there was not only nothing she could do but that it was my fault. Her tone was condescending at best. When we got to the airport we asked to have seats further up in the plane since our seats were crap at this point but they told us the plane was completely full and no possible way to change. When we finally loaded up there was about 8 people total on the entire flight. So the airline had every opportunity to fix our experience at basically no cost to themselves and decided to pass. Couldn't have treated us more poorly unless they were United.

Oh and on top of it they don't even offer you water on the flight."|british-airways
400|"One of the cheapest airlines in terms of service. You have to pay for everything; you basically have to pay to breathe on this airline. Choosing your seat before the check-in date, talking to a representative.... There is a fee for almost everything.
Unless you are their loyal customer, you cannot even see all the seats when it comes to checking in, you cannot even buy a seat on the exit row even if you wish to do so.
I had a problem with the check-in, so I wanted to ask help through online chat; but guess what, they don't have such a thing. They can get you access to a human!!!! For $20!!!
Long story short, this has been one of the most disappointing flights I have ever flown with..... Next time, I am going to stick to Delta, or KLM, Or anything else.
On our flight back, airline suggested a flight with 1 hour lay over at LHR and sure enough, the in bound from Amsterdam was delayed. We got to a massive size airport with 14 minutes to get to the next flight. My arms were still shaking when we made it to our flight when the final call announcement was going on.
This will definitely be my last time flying with British airlines. Too much stress to handle...."|british-airways

402|I flew with British Airways from Montreal to London Heathrow. I really liked the flight. We were in economy class, and managed to get a decent sleep on the 6 hour flight. The flight was comfortable, the seats were comfortable and the ride was smooth. We were on one of their brand new Boeing 787 Dreamliners, which is a super comfortable aircraft. I live in Chicago, and we connected through Montreal. They do offer direct flights twice daily from O'Hare, on much larger aircraft. We used miles on American, who is partners with BA, so we weren't on a direct flight. But I enjoyed this airline, and I highly recommend using this airline.|british-airways
403|"Was flying in from Heathrow. Logan airport was out of fuel so the plane had to make an emergency landing in bangor main. I wanted to make a phone call to let the people picking me up to know that my arrival time is being delayed but my phone was out of battery.

I asked the staff to provide me a phone call and they failed to do so when the plane made an emergency landing in Bangor Maine. In fact the staff failed to provide any shape of response to my request they just ignored me not even told me things like ""we are sorry we can't"". Just walked away and didn't come back. Rude.  

Ok there was more. The the flight attendant guy who didn't provide me with a phone call was being nosy.

He asked me a uneducated/poorly worded question
""EXCUSE ME BUT WHY DO YOU NOT HAVE A CELL PHONE PLAN?""

( This would be equivalent to going to a restaurant, ask for some napkins and the staff asking you "" excuse me why do you not have not have napkins at home?"" ).

Found this close ended question quite one dimensional and random.  And he raised his voice loud when he asked that question so that other passengers could hear it. Very weird.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a white person asks for a phone call, it's probably because the phone is not working. When a minority person asks for a phone call, it's MUST BE because he or she does not have a cell phone plan. Right?. You are not even going to bother why I am asking for a call, you are just going to assume automatically that I do not have a cell phone plan.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I hope this british airline flight attendant guy thinks just a little bit more before opening his mouth in front of the passengers. Like how would you feel if I said something like ""OH YOU LOOK PLUMP! WHY DO YOU NOT LOOSE SOME WEIGHT AND GET RID OF THAT HUGE MOLE ON YOUR FACE?""

Please think before you speak, especially towards passengers who are not British like you unless you want give off that xenophobe vibe to your passengers.

Asking for a phone call is quite a reasonable thing to do when your plane makes an emergency landing. And No, asking for a phone call does not mean I don't have a cell phone plan. Have you not traveled before in your life? All in all this interaction gave me the impression that the staff is not capable of handling situations and I was just glad the emergency landing was just for fuel instead of a some disaster. I am not sure if I would like these people to be the ones looking after my safety. Good bye british airways!.

404|"As group of four adults, we flew from LAX to LHR on our way to a 14 day cruise.  We paid for first class tickets, which is supposed to give you priority luggage pick up.  Arriving at London Heathrow, very comfortable flight and service on board.  Our luggage was nowhere to be seen.  We had checked four medium sized bags in LA 2 1/2 hours prior to our direct flight.  departure.  We were assured our bags were there but after waiting 3 hours with our transport car waiting, we were finally told they did not know where our bags were!  They filled out our lost baggage form, we were treated like we did something wrong and were just adding to their work load.  They told us our bags would be sent to our next port in two days.  Well 9 DAY'S later, several emails and long waiting on the phone to BA, which cost quite a bit on the cruise ship.  Only three of our four bags were sent to our ship!  We were not far from London on our cruise, so I don't understand how our bags could be LOST for so long on a direct flight!  We found the fourth bag just prior to our flight back home on day 14.  
We didn't  get a reply from BA for compensation for clothing we had to buy until three months later.   They refuse to pay for all the phone calls and emails we had to send them.  Calls from the ship are over $7.00/min.  One call was over 100 minutes long,  just giving BA all the information they needed.  Also, they will only compensate you for your itemized receipts,  they refuse to pay our extra charges for our car waiting nor our prepaid excursion that we missed because they told us to wait for our luggage which ultimately was not found!  Very poor service to frequent flyers.  
Luggage can be lost on any flight but the difference is in the customer service, which was non existent with BA.  No loyalty on their part!  Just be warned."|british-airways

With fully paid business class tickets from MUC to LHR British Airways casually cancels our  flight and puts us on the next flight AFTER downgrading us to economy by sending a short mobile notice telling us it is so! We go to the counter and ask why.  They give us 10 pages of BS saying complain to the company as if it will make a difference. The agent, Ivan, is kind and tries to be helpful by giving us passes to the lounge and group 1 boarding.  [BA had originally put us on Group 4.  i.e. last to board with no overhead bin space left...] We go to the lounge, this old woman at the front desk, with the thickest weird accent I have ever heard, tells us 'no' and starts calling some office with a comment:  ""Why are you sending all THOSE people to me.  The lounge is full"".  Apparently she is told to allow us in so she throws our tickets back at us with one work 'OK'.  The irony is we go into the lounge there are 8 people including us.... and today I find they have given us a $50.00 credit on our card for -- no idea why.  $50 for a downgrade of  two tickets at $350 each!???

407|"Sorry Airlines!!

I had the worst experience of my life and I will ensure that my friends and family never suffer.

BA is a joke.  I booked my flight 2 months ahead and had everything sorted out yet on the final day they say that out of 2 tickets I booked one is stand by and my online check in is no longer valid so I was dumped in last row ..what the fun...

The crew was so unfriendly,  that guy was yelling,  ignoring or were servicing the food as if he was doing it for free.  I've paid $1500 do you know what is courtesy ? Hospitality and customer service.

Upon getting down,  I had 1 hr to catch hyd flight,  their ground staff had no clue on what they were doing. They took us in some short route to the gate and boooom the flight is gone,  I was shocked and the response is ""Sorry,  you are late"",  what the fun.. I was with your staff. ..you guys are insane. .

Then more drama, they rebooked us via 2 more hops,  they threw a #10 pound token and didn't honor request for a good seat. Staff were constantly saying ""Sorry,  we can't help"".  I lost 12 hrs of travel because their staff lack coordination and you are giving me these peanuts to spend time ?

We spent 6 hrs in the dirty airport and eventually got off.  In flight the entertainment system were not working,  so another sorry.  Flight was delayed  20 min as one crew of the members was missing so another sorry.  You didn't honor a customer with your ground staff and flew away but you kept the flight on hold for 20 min. .. Finally another sorry. .

Their alliance flight was another horrible story without entertainment system and I was thanking God for reaching home.

Now,  it's my turn to give it back.  I will ensure that none of my closed one go through this.  I manage a large travel system for an iT giant, I will recommend that my firm no longer book BA which usually spend $5M on travel.

In one line,  they are sorry airline and won't value your time,  business and nothing."|british-airways
408|"I took a $119 USD flight from Italy to London with British Airway and I got the best service ever. The staff that helps you check in and the flight attendants deserve 5 stars. They are absolutely amazing and are willing to answer or help you in away. They also gave everyone a gluten free organic chicken or vegan wrap on the short flight . The seats were comfy, the plane was clean and customer service was amazing. It was my first time using British and I loved it !

European airlines always get you when it comes to extra luggage and weight. British Airways lets you take one carry on and check in one bag for free.

Amazing experience ."|british-airways
409|I travel all over the world.  On all different airlines. First of all, if I am paying for business class, I expect a seat that isn't coach!   I just sat in a row of coach seats where they put a little table in between the seats.  So it hardly went back and there was no additional place for my feet.  I'm glad I didn't fly first class.  The food was frightening.  The flight attendants make it clear that you annoy them by simply being on the plane.  Avoid this airline; I will in the future.|british-airways

This review is to do with their loyalty scheme and companion voucher.

These are linked with American Express, and it is the BA card.  

First moan, I paid £16 for using the AMEX card to book a flight.

Then having spent £20000 over the year they give me Companion Voucher.  The only dates I could use this are during the school holidays.  Every place I tried, and every permutation resulted in the dates not being available.  Even trying to use just the AVIOS points produced a blank.

I have yet to speak with BA, but I am decidedly dischuffed!!!!

To contact them I get charged, and they a routine that extends the call instead of going straight into the options.  I have waited over 15 minutes, and really just decided to give up.

They never seem to answer e-mails very quickly if at all.  When they do, they fail to read the question that has been asked, and reply to something not asked.  They seem to think that all of their FAQs solve all of the problems.

414|"Downgraded on flight from LHR to SFO with no notice other than I wasn't able to select a seat for week before flight. Economy Plus tickets available all week prior to flight. Whiplash suffered at Flight Connections in LHR when they told me they would issue economy and upgrade me if the class I had paid for and been issued a ticket for became available at gate. Duty Manager at gate was worthless jobsworth who clearly dealt with this corrupt overbooking scam every day. Selling standby seats in a higher class as actual seats is false advertising and fraudulent and has legal ramifications which I am now pursuing. BA could easily overbook economy and get people to pay the $125 they figure my involuntary downgrade was worth on day of departure as an upgrade at the airport....oh wait the upgrade is $1000+ when overbooked...

I am an obese man and booked a world traveller plus seat because of my health issues - I had zero intention of travelling for 10 hours with my thighs pinned between two arm rests with an obnoxious lady pissed off about having a middle seat poking her elbow in my ribs for over half the journey (I have always let middle seat passengers have the arm rest but she decided this meant she could have her elbows 3 inches in to my actual seat space which is what I wanted to avoid by purchasing economy plus)

The subsequent interactions with customer service have been typical corporate brush offs  interspersed with multiple false statements...""We overbook to keep our ticket prices low"" was the most hilarious so far...no, you overbook when someone agrees to pay more than the people who already booked who you then bump with a ""refund"" and no compensation. The duty manager had the audacity to claim he had asked everyone in economy plus if they wanted to volunteer to not travel with compensation - except he didn't because none of the 4 passengers who were involuntarily downgraded received that option...

Miserable experience still ongoing...

415|"I had an 8 day trip to London planned months in advance. To get there, I would first fly with Air Berlin and transfer at Tegel to British Airways. Unfortunately the transfer time was short and they must not have had the time to transfer my bag despite me having boarded the plane. After I arrived at Heathrow and realized my bag was lost, I filled out a report and left without being given any compensation.

For the next 8 days, I became increasingly frustrated by the complete lack of efficiency and knowledge of how to do their jobs. It was not until the fifth day when the man I spoke with at the baggage tracing office even told me where my bag was. It turns out that my bag had been sitting at Tegel undisturbed for my entire trip. There had been no effort made to send it on a new flight. I had spent the first few days still hopeful and only buying bare minimum but by the fifth day I went out and bought all the things I should have bought on the very first day. I guess I just really didn't think an airline like British Airways would so blatantly not care. At all.

At the end of my London trip I headed to Tegel for my 4 day trip to Berlin. Once there I was informed that the situation with my bag was not handled because no one would accept responsibility for dealing with the bags and sending them forward to their owners. So while I was crying by myself from sheer anger and frustration, they were literally doing nothing.

I have been trying to send the Baggage Compensation Form for the past week. Unfortunately, every time I try and fill it out, an error box appears at the top without any clue as to WHAT was filled out incorrectly (though to the best of my knowledge it is all correct). Every time I have attempted to call Customer Relations they have hung up on me! I sent Customer Relations an email and they put me on their long line of complaints. It is impossible to get in touch with anyone on their side and when I have had the joy of hearing someone on the other side I was met with impatience, ambivalence and downright rudeness (one operator very snarkily told me to calm down despite me having been separated from my baggage for over half my trip).

At this point, British Airways will have ruined my trip, forced me to buy necessary clothing, toiletries and other necessities that would have otherwise been unneccessary had I had my bag and now I'm pretty sure I won't be able to send the Compensation Form because I can't get in touch with Customer Relations."|british-airways

Yup, that's what BA is. Every other scheduled airline worth its salt (step forward, Singapore Airlines, Malaysia, Qantas, Emirates) let you pre-book your seats on-line when you've bought your ticket. Despite charging premium prices, BA charge £28 to pre-book an ordinary economy seat

As I'm typing, Willy Walsh is still sitting on his hands and allowing his customers to suffer uncertainty rather than getting round the table to negotiate properly and end the BA strike. Ego has no place in business, Mr Walsh.

419|"I'm a Continental Airlines girl.

For a reason that is long and detailed and not necessary for this review, I flew British Airways roundtrip to my London vacation. I am so happy I did.

Booking with BA was smooth and easy. Check-in was quick and thorough, and on the way back to the US, the attendant at check-in upgraded me to World Class seating, which is a hugely amazing upgrade from the regular coach seats (bigger seat, bigger television, foot rest for sleeping, nicer table, menu for food, better service, better movie selection, etc.).

Boarding was prompt, as was take-off and landing. Landing was 45 minutes early for both flights.

The flight attendants are wildly friendly and attentive. They are extremely perky and enthusiastic and truly care about their customers. I managed to sleep for three hours on the 8-hour flight back because of how at-ease I felt on the flight.

When flying to Europe, I will now highly consider booking with British Airways."|british-airways
420|Simply pathetic customer service, to be more precise absolutely zero customer service!!! I flew into Heathrow for a connecting flight. I then spent 2 hours waiting for a gate update on the status screen then 3 hours with a delayed flight status screen just to have the status screen go blank for another 3 and a half hours. So after 8.5 hours I then had to stand in a line snaking through Heathrow Airport just to be handed a sheet of paper with a phone number and told I had to call it to rebook my flight and the service desk would not help me or anyone else in line. Therefor after waiting 12 hours I spent the next hour and a half trying to get through to the number on the sheet of paper to rebook without ever getting through. At that point I spent an hour and 20 minutes trying to get through to my travel agent to rebook during a high demand time. I finally got through to may travel agent and spent another 40 minutes on the phone to get the first seat available which was three days after my original flight. There were no rooms for the night available at that point so I had to book for a check-in the next day for the remaining two nights. I ended up sitting in the terminal for the night waiting for my room to open up at the hotel the next day. The bad customer service was: 1. Not updating the delayed flight screen and simply blanking out the status. 2. Making customers stand in line for 3.5 hours just to be told the service desk was not was not going help you. Instead of being proactive by sending someone to go along the line and handing out the sheet of paper with a useless number on it and telling those in line they were not going to rebook your flight or help you in any way. 3. not offering any compensation or vouchers for a hotel or meals due to the delayed/canceled flight. I have told my travel agent not to ever book me on British Airways again. Fifteen hours to get a flight rebooked, with no help whatsoever from British Airways, for three days later then a night in the terminal waiting for a room to open up in a local hotel that I had to pay for and no meal or transportation to a local hotel vouchers, meaning I was also paying for those out of pocket. Simply pathetic customer service!!!! The flight delay and cancellation was of course due to bad weather, but the lack of even an attempt at any form of customer service was pathetic and unforgivable!|british-airways
421|"$332 nope.

$402 US to reserve our seat assignments in advance.

422|"One might argue that this isn't really *your* problem, but it really is.

I made a booking for two using American Airlines Advantage miles for a trip out of San Francisco to Nairobi (via LHR) and return. Ok, so it took me a week and some very creative routing but I was finally able to complete our trip. Now for the easy part (wait for it.......) SEAT SELECTION!

AA could not have made this any easier. They put my wife in our seats and I still have online access to change them as often I was want to wherever I want. But BA, is another story.

Since this is AA booking, AA is not able to give us advanced seat assignments. I need to book those separately through either your website or by calling and provide you with a (yet again) a separate confirmation number. I am a grown up and I can handle doing this, so I called your central reservations.

The reservationists asked for our booking reference numbers and found our record. So far so good. We have 3 legs booked with BA including Heathrow to Nairobi and Nairobi to London and then onto Mexico City. One of the legs (London to Mexico City) is in Business Class and the others in Economy. We start off with the London to Nairobi and find two seats together and get ready to book our seats when the reservationists then asks for my credit card number.

Why do they need my credit card you ask?

It's because BA charges $38 USD to assign seats. That's each seat for each leg! 3 legs at $38! Nope, not really it gets better! Since we are flying in Business Class out of London to Mexico City they charge $90 USD for that! And if you want to sit up stairs (747) it's $125 USD each! Are you kidding me, wouldn't you think that upgrading might allow for at least allowing you free advanced seat assignments?

In the end $332 USD for advanced seat assignments.

I know this is an industry thing, but I am growing tired. No scratch that. I am passed the ""growing tired"" and am just plain fed up with being nickeled to death with airline fees. Sorry about the American expression, but I think you Londoners get the point.

Flying used to be fun and part of the enjoyment of vacation planning. But charging for seat assignments, bags, curb side check in, etc etc just makes me air sick."|british-airways
423|"This could have been a two star review but I bumped it to three stars since the airport and flight crew were very good.  The airline itself just doesn't get customer service.  We couldn't select our seats in advance, having to wait until we arrived at the airport to know if our family would be seated together.  Our friends ended up being separated.  

Our tickets were purchased months in advance and discounted as a block but that isn't a reasonable excuse for not allowing seats to be assigned.  We couldn't even check-in 24 hours before the flight and their help desk kept transferring us from one phone number to another without providing an answer.

The food was typically British, rather boring and over cooked.  

Typical of this airline to just ignore something this important that they can control.  I'll be flying another airline in the future."|british-airways

We flew from Blantyre, Malawi on South African Air to Johannesburg, where we were suddenly told that our 2 suitcases were a little over a kilogram overweight and we would have to pay an additional $85.87 for each bag. We questioned this, since they allow 2 suitcases per person and we only had one each, but were told they don't figure things that way. We offered to take out the few heavy items and put them in our carryons, but then were told our suitcases couldn't be accessed. Very convenient!

426|"My wife and I flew from London-Heathrow to Baltimore Washington (BWI) on 7 January 2017.  We were in premium economy and loved our seats. My 6'6"" frame makes normal coach class a challenge.   The leg room, seat width, service and overall experience motivates me to want to fly this route again and buy at least the premium economy seats.  The transatlantic flights are simply too long to squeeze into a normal coach class seat and not be miserable.

We were very pleased to get help from British Air personnel at Gatwick when we arrived there from Spain the night before.  We had booked our travel with American and found it impossible to check in via either the American or British Air web sites.  We did not know what seats we had on the Heathrow-BWI flight (or even if we had seats).  Ms. Rebecca Young (Becky?) at Gatwick was able to get us details and get us checked in.  Ms. Young explained that Gatwick-printed boarding cards would not be valid at Heathrow so she advised us to get new boarding cards at Heathrow.    That was not a problem-- we had to check bags the next morning anyway.

The food on the Heathrow to BWI flight was actually very good. I am not usually one to eat much of an airline meal but this one was on point.

Our travel from Heathrow to Bilbao, Spain on 27 December 2016 was a very pleasant experience. My wife and I had an empty seat next to us and the short two-hour flight really went quickly thanks to good weather and excellent service.

Our flight from NY-JFK to London-Heathrow in late December was OK although I am just getting too old / lack the flexibility/resilience to sit in coach class and be comfortable.  We were amazed at the disorderly boarding process that British Air used at JFK.   Part of the problem is the large number of passengers who ignored the repeated calls for only passengers in certain rows to come forward.  The boarding process for the Heathrow to BWI flight did not involve a staggered boarding process but, unlike JFK, had the space and people actually queued up.  I would have preferred a staggered boarding process instead of standing in a queue that seemed to form frustrating branches.

Fortunately, we were able to find sufficient space in the bins for our bags stuffed with fragile gifts we received the day we departed from Spain.  (We had no option to mail the items.  We had to take them with us and were quite concerned about room in the bins on the transatlantic flight.)

Baggage collection in Bilbao, Spain was fast.  Baggage collection at BWI was horrible due, only in part, to a jammed conveyor.  BWI baggage claim is, based on my dozens of experiences, horrible.  My hopes that the international baggage claim experience might be good were dashed on 7 January 2017.  I had never used BWI before for an international arrival.  It sure was convenient for us, much closer than our normally-used airport (Dulles) for international trips.

Given that we expect to return to Spain many times in the coming years, our preferred route will probably be British Air from BWI to Spain via London in premium economy.  For us, the cost is worth it!"|british-airways

428|"BA finally repaid me for my damaged baggage, 7 weeks later. It was a pleasant surprise since I had written it off as a lost cause. Still I appreciate the effort; it would suggest they value my business.

I'll probably fly with them again."|british-airways
429|"I've flown with BA for several year now. Food has been quite good and experience.

However on my last trip too many things went wrong:

Delayed baggage
Damaged baggage
2 of 4 flights delayed well over an hour
Stuck in plane on tarmac for an hour
Security issues with my tablet
etc...
Customer service not responding to my follow up

The last gaffe is what is ending my relationship with BA. Your break my suitcase, you replace it. Simple as that. Perhaps I'll avoid ""airways"" from now on when I fly (U.S Airways is minus 5 stars). Lufthansa seemed quite good the one time I flew with them."|british-airways
430|"What is strange is that...there has been no review for British Airways (London Heathrow).

I have flown through this airport several times in the past year, and I have to say, as awesome of an airport Heathrow is...British Airways just makes the traveling experience in London a sad one. Though the employees are very nice, and the airline does book its stranded guests in a gorgeous hotel, I seem to always lose my luggage here for several days. ): The only exception was when I flew to London for a weekend trip from Berlin. But every time I have flown from/to the States, I always lost my luggage.

Of course, this is not without a fault to American Airlines. And I also hate that British Airways did not inform me that my flight from Berlin to London was canceled due to employees' strike. That was very unprofessional, and it has been the last time I have dealt with British Airways. Not that I won't ever fly with them again, but be a little cautious if you are flying through BA and Heathrow for a layover."|british-airways
431|The BEST customer service of any airline. Iberia lost my bags prior to connecting to a BA flight and the agents of British air were amazingly friendly. They even gave me a little overnight bag with a t-shirt and toiletries b/c I had nothing to sleep in. They traced my bag and kept me updated on the whereabouts until it was delivered. Flying with them was also a pleasure. The flight attendants were lovely. The meal was tasty and drinks were free! Wish they flew more places I travel b/c I would def fly them as much as possible.|british-airways
432|"As someone who logs at least a few transatlantic flights per year on average, I can tell you that few other airlines do it better than BA.

I've flown with several different airlines across the pond from the US to Europe and back (USAirways, Delta, Continental, American, Finn Air, Lufthansa, etc.) and would happily choose British Airways over any of the ones listed above.  Here are some reasons why:

-Their service is spot on, staff has always been outgoing and friendly.

-I don't think I've arrived to my destination late on any BA flight (though one recent flight did take off an hour late, they made up that time while in the air).

-The seats are comfortable (have you ever been stuck in the same uncomfortable airplane seat for 8+ hours, having to shift your weight every few moments because the seats were that bad? I've had that experience with other airlines, but not with BA).

-Unlike some other airlines that still have the old TVs hanging from the ceiling with a few of the same movies for everyone to watch during the flight, BA provides an individual entertainment system in every seat on the plane. You can use the LCD screen to look at the flight plan and get updates as to when you'll be arriving at your destination city and what the weather's like there, you can watch movies on demand, TV programs and play a number of games to help pass time time.

-While at least a few other carriers have cut out complimentary wine and alcohol with dinner on transatlantic flights, BA still happily offers this perk to its passengers. The food quality on BA flights is also as good or better than any other airline I've flown with.

-When you fly with BA, they give each passenger an amenities package that includes a blanket and pillow, a headset, a toothbrush and toothpaste to refresh yourself after the long 8+ hour flight, ear plugs, a mask/blindfold, and socks or slippers to wear during the flight. Most other major carriers only offer a blanket and pillow.

In short, BA is a class act, they know what their customers want, and they're happy to provide it for them. My only 2 possible suggestions would be that they think about adding in-flight WiFi as some US domestic airlines have done (a Godsend for business travellers and for people who need to stay connected), and it was nice to have a power outlet at every seat in the plane on a recent flight I took with another carrier.  This is something that BA doesn't yet offer as well."|british-airways
433|"Having traveled the world mainly on BA but many other airlines, the ground staff have to be the most incapable and inefficient in the airline industry. They just love to pass the buck, in particular their lounge staff.
Even though I have a huge lot of Avoid miles , I will never travel BA again."|british-airways
434|"Just did JFK-Heathrow this morning with BA. Not  an impressive experience, and below the standards of competing European airlines like SAS, Lufthansa, etc.

The machine, BA 182 was old and not well kept, and the breakfast consisted of the most dry croissant I've ever seen. Happy that I'm not French - could have caused a heart attack!

Service was nice, though."|british-airways
435|"UPDATE - Our BA flight from London to Athens was 2 hours late, causing us to miss our onward Aegean Air flight to Santorini. We ran around from one airline desk to another in the middle of the night, various staff having trouble with English, no BA staff available even until 6:30 am, and were eventually forced to buy fresh tickets from Aegean. On our return trip when checking into BA Club World again at Athens, many pax had to stand in line about an hour because Club World checkin systems appeared to be down. Glad we and others arrived hours early. On-board customer service was solid, but hard product is lacking a bit vs. competitors for a ""business class"" product.

On returning back to the US, we reached out to various regional customer service heads but all we got were repetitions of our case details, from the online customer service department. At this point, we are out more than US$500 extra due to BA with no resolution. After being with BA for over a decade, this entire experience has made us reconsider BA for our future paid world travel. You should too - there certainly are better hard products out there, and with non-airborne customer service clearly unhelpful, worth spending your loyalty dollars elsewhere."|british-airways
436|"EDIT - It's costing me about $300 for the tourist visa and hotel alone. Not cool BA.

A bit of a mixed experience with BA this time around. Been flying with them for over a decade with generally good results. Except the points of course which are hard to redeem valuably along with the fuel surcharges.

In 2015, I booked a Club World roundtrip from the US to Europe for summer 2016. Since booking, they have changed/cancelled flights twice and if I hadn't been on top of my emails, I would have never known the discrepancy. No calls from BA to alert in order to rebook. On both occasions, I called them and after being on hold for about 45 mins, their agents were gracious to rebook an available flight combination that worked without any penalties. This second time though, the flights changed such that an overnight layover in London became mandatory due to availability. Unfortunately they are not willing to compensate/reimburse for the hotel and tourist visa that I'll now need to fork out extra $ for and do a 3 week application process for. Apparently their conditions of carriage dictate that they can compensate only if their change in flights happens within 24 hours of scheduled takeoff. All they could do is let me lodge a complaint over the phone, which they responded to via email immediately as well.

Since I would have been forced to go through this whether they changed flights now or in the 24 hour window, their policies seemed illogical. I think they are the only/one of the few carriers to charge Business Class pax fees for choosing seats. Wish some of their policies were more customer-friendly. Would be great if they could at a minimum reimburse for the extra $ and time they've caused by upending my itinerary now."|british-airways
437|"This is my first choice when I travel in Europe.  I usually purchase up-front seating, so I can take my bag (always free) and a personal item on board as well as board in the priority boarding group.  I have used them repeatedly and I've never had any problems.

You can print your boarding pass well ahead of travel.  In the US, usually it's only available 24-hours ahead of time, which is difficult if your trip has multiple legs.  

I read through a lot of the negative reviews and many of them are from folks who didn't read on their website that you get one bag, or for things that are out of the airline's control (strikes, airport employees, etc,)--not all but many.  So go read their policies before you book.

The EasyJet folks we've dealt with have always been very pleasant.  Snacks on the plane are affordable.  I almost always grab a Twix and a Coke.  Even thought it is a budget carrier, it feels pretty relaxed.  My daughter had an outstanding sandwich on our last flight.  It was 10 euros for the whole meal (sandwich, chips, and drink).  That's what I pay in the cafeteria at my work!

I've not have a single glitch and I would not hesitate to use them again."|easyjet
438|"No problems, but I agree with the folks who say it's worth it to upgrade a little.  I picked a seat and got an extra bag for just a few dollars more.  That meant I was in priority boarding.  Since you line up around an hour before you board, being in the priority line is extra sweet.

Other than that it's on par with other low price airlines.  The planes are not as new as WOW or as nice as the one's I was on for Norwegian Air.  I'd say it was similar to Spirit in the USA.  

Folks were nice and they don't weigh carry-ons.  Just make sure they are the right size."|easyjet
439|"Worst airline ever!!!! The staff was rude, and they charged 50 pounds for a damn purse. They are money hungry. Staff doesn't mentioned anything about paying for a purse, (which is considered a second bag) until they scan the tickets. Unreal situation!!!!!
The worst part is that I paid extra for my purse, and they tagged my carry-on which I wasn't allowed to bring it with me, it was left outside in the rain. FIRST AND LAST TIME!!!!!"|easyjet
440|"It's a quiet small airline, at first glance it doesn't seem that bad, however this has to be the worst airline I have ever had the pleasure of using. I mean my mistake, I should have known but please do yourself, your friends, family and the rest of humanity a favor and move on when you come across easyjet as an option.

First off they wrote my ticket by hand, no bar code to scan so how was I suppose to scan my ticket at security? Who knows?

Prior to boarding I was told I could not take my carry on with me because I was not a priority flyer, it was  either my personal item or my carry on. I had a layover from Bordeaux in London, my last stop was Los Angeles. I was told I could pay 60€ and collect my carry on at the luggage claim in London. They would not put the bag on my connecting flight. Even if I checked a bag, they would not have had time to pick it up due to my short layover in London. Although they still refused to transfer the bag to the connecting flight.

The woman who I was dealing with was an insufferable woman, not a nice person at all.

Look to be honest just don't use this airline, it's not worth saving the few bucks. I would rather take a boat back to LA from France than fly with this company. If I could put zero stars....if I could take away stars I would. Thank you for giving me the worst experience I've had flying."|easyjet
441|"PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF WHAT EVER GOD YOU BELIEVE IN!!!

PLEASE READ BEFORE BOOKING!!!!!!!!!

My wife and I where on vacation for a week in Germany. On our way back home our last city we where was Berlin and we took a easyjet flight from their to Munich then we would jump on the plain home back to San Francisco. As soon as we arrived at the berlin airport thats where everything went sideways.

We arrived at the airport a hour and thirty minutes before our flight. We had bags that we wanted to check in witch is normal. but when we got to the bag check in everything stopped. Some time had passed and our flight was taking off in one hour and we did not have time to wait. My wife asked me to talk to the front desk person to see if she could help. I asked her what was going on? She replied with "" i dont know?"", ( upon a further look in the back i saw that the belt that takes everything was broken and the staff was on their phones.).  then i asked will our bags make it on our flight? again she said ""i don't know, mabey???"". then she took our bags and said ""just go the bags will get on!""  

Now with only 30 minutes to spare we made it to the plain. But every minute that passed we felt more and more unsure about our bags making it on the plain. we talked to one nice lady on the plain, told her what had happened, and came back to and said all bags that were meant for this flight made it  on. we felt happy for the moment.

when we landed in Munich, waiting for our bags praying that they would make it, when is was all said and done they did not come, and the same was true for about 20 other people. what made things even worse is when we get to the lost and found at the Munich airport, while there was a nice lady helping  us all out, there was a young english boy making inappropriate jokes to her, the other staff all in front of customers!

My final note is that out of the almost 20+ years i have been flying, both in the U.S. and across the world. from big air lines to small south west flights. Flying with easyjet has to be by far the most worst, unorganized, unhelpful air line i have ever been on in my entire life. i rather walk, swim, and climb across Europe than fly with easyjet.

long story short, EASYJET IS NOT EASY!!!!"|easyjet
442|This airline sucks! Don't do it!!! Delayed times and flights, not to mention when you get to your destination, there's only 1 person checking passports. Worst ever.|easyjet
443|Booked a flight with these folks in January before the Chinese virus hit. They are refusing to refund any money even though it is impossible for us to get to Copenhagen. In essence they are stealing nearly $600 American from me. Under no circumstances fly this airline.|easyjet
444|"Obviously - if I could give no stars, I would.

I'm writing in reference to EasyJet flight EVKW334 from London to Berlin on August 9th. During this flight I was verbally abused by crew members Ellis and Karen. More importantly, I was racially abused.

Before take-off, I was asked to put a small bag that contained a sandwich in the compartment in front of me. Not wanting to crush my sandwich, I gently said, ""seriously"", to which Ellis immediately raised her voice and started shouting down at me like a child. I looked at the gentleman next to me who was holding his computer in his lap and gently said, ""this is ridiculous"", to which Ellis immediately went off at me even more and demanded that I move from 1F to 3D. Since I did not do anything wrong and felt her tone was way out of order, I refused twice, to which she said, ""you better move now or this plane is not moving."" Not wanting to cause trouble, I moved.

While moving, I heard Ellis mumble (dickhead), which crew member Karen thought was hilarious. As I sat in my new seat, I noticed that I was the only black person on the plane. With the plane filled with mostly older German and British white males, 'of course' I got looks as if I was the trouble maker. It goes without saying that I felt humiliated from the way I was treated. Before the plane took off, I watched Ellis and Karen's conversation and saw Ellis mouth the words (black bastard), obviously referring to me. Both Karen and Ellis refused to take my trash as they did the other white passengers. After falling asleep at take-off, I was harrassed out of my sleep 10 times for various reasons. Twice being asked for my passport to which I refused.

By the time we landed, the crew had the German police escort me from the plane and take my passport. Totally ridiculous seeing that there was no verbal or physical abuse 'at all'. There was no interaction with the pilot who 'I assume' called the police about the supposed issue. He took the word of his crew instead of myself and most people who witnessed the incident in the 1st three rows. While leaving the plane the pilot smirked and said ""let's see how you get your return flight home, cause you're not flying Easyjet.""He was essentially trying to say that I was now on a no fly list for a situation that him and his crew blew completely out of control.

YES, I plan on posting this incident on as many forums and review sites as possible. I will not stand for racial profiling or verbal abuse. with that said, it seems like EasyJet does. I will NEVER fly this airline again and will be requesting the full refund of my flight as well as further compensation.

It's sad that in today's world, people are still bigoted and racist. Unfortunately, people would rather be affraid of those they consider 'different'. I was singled out during this flight and made out to be 'the black guy who causes issues'. Not fair and not right."|easyjet
445|"Love this airline. It may be budget but the people are all very nice and super helpful. There was never a line checking in the bags, nice greeting and plenty of overhead.
Seats don't lean back and gates aren't close but the flights are reasonable.

Take it and enjoy."|easyjet
446|"Wow, I'm glad I didn't check Yelp before booking our one-way flight from Edinburgh to Prague. I hadn't ever heard of EasyJet before looking into options, but it kept coming up in my searches, and they always had the best price (depending on the day of travel, of course).

I got the sense from the site itself that this airline would be the equivalent of a JetBlue flight - cheap airfare, but everything else would cost me. And in that, I was right.

We paid to sit together. We paid to have our bags flown to Prague with us. They wanted us to pay for other things along the way, but we declined.

Though they charge for every hold bag you plan to bring with you, and though they have restrictions on weight, your allowance can be spread among all your bags, so if you have one very heavy one (like us), you won't pay an overage if your baggage weight is less than the total allowed.

Did that make sense?

I downloaded the app and synced everything up prior to even leaving the United States. I had received an e-mail about a month before we were set to travel, telling me that check-in for the flight was open. That was unheard of, but I took advantage of that by checking in from San Diego.

I then used the app and the site to update our baggage information, and to verify all the pertinent details.

The morning of our flight, we got to the airport super early because we wanted to make sure we got to the gate with enough time to spare. We had heard all kinds of horror stories about how airlines like this will close the gates and not allow passengers on board, and we were not trying to have that happen to us.

Upon entering the airport, we quickly found the counter for EasyJet, and headed towards the self-check kiosks. We had three hold bags in total, and used the kiosks in conjunction with the app on my phone in order to get everything properly checked in. It went smoothly for the first two bags, but when we got to the big one, it printed out our tags, but then gave us an error. We walked up to the first person we saw and told her what happened; she told us we needed to go to the counter.

At the counter - with all three bags in tow - we told the agent there what had transpired, and she ran our tickets through to see what had happened. If she found out, she didn't share the details with us. But what she did do was verify that everything was in order, and took our bags for us, before letting us know where we had to go to get to our gate.

The wait at the gate wasn't terrible. They opened the doors on time, and directed us to the correct boarding location once we were through.

The flight was smooth and on time. It was a bit jarring, though - the first announcement made over the intercom was not in English, and it was the first time I actually felt like we were in a different country while on this trip.

Maybe our experience was out of the norm, but I have no reason to hate on this airline. The service, the pricing and the accountability was just fine for us."|easyjet
447|"Fine for any journey that's under two hours.
It's a bus service in the sky, but with more lunatics as passengers and an utterly dehumanising experience before you board.
Saying that, certainly better than most budget airlines and I include BA in this too."|easyjet
448|"EasyJet provided the absolute worse flying experience of my life. Their customer service was abysmal. My girlfriend and I flew with them from Marco Polo Airport to London Gatwick on November 14th 2018.

First, upon arrival we asked for help with the self check-in: They told us that we could not check-in until two hours before the flight via any method. We knew that was not the case, we eventually figured it out on our own. We had to create a separate login for each of us to check-in and download the boarding pass.

Second, we were ""TOLD"" we had to check one of our two carry on bags ""because the flight was too full"" when boarding the plane. I could not understand how they randomly told my girlfriend to check her bag, which was smaller than mine, but did not make me check mine. I was directly behind her. Once we boarded the flight we realized the flight was under half way full, we had an empty seat beside us and there was was only two people across the isle as well. To top it off the two restrooms were out of order.

All in all we will not be flying EasyJet again nor would I recommend anyone fly with them, you save a small amount of money and their poor service and terrible attitudes more then over compensated for that small discount."|easyjet
449|"FLY EASYJET ONLY IF YOUR DON'T CARE ABOUT LATE FLIGHTS AND FLIGHT CANCELLATIONS!
I recently took my 14 year old sons on their first trip to Europe. Against my better judgement, I booked an EasyJet flight from Paris-Orly to Berlin-TXL because of the low fare and non-stop flight. The flight was delayed for 90 minutes, and all the while EasyJet let us sit there thinking that it would still fly that evening. After 90 minutes (during which time we could have been looking at flight alternatives had we known), they abruptly cancelled the flight with no explanation. Because EasyJet flies only a few flights on this route each day, the following day was immediately booked up. I had checked a bag, and of course it was a nightmare getting it back after the flight was cancelled.

I cancelled the booking and got a refund and rebooked on a 1 stop connection the next day from Paris-CDG to Berlin, which was over $1,000 more than what I had paid for the EasyJet flight.

All in all, we lost over $1,000 in having to rebook other flights, and even more importantly, we lost an entire precious day from our 13 day trip.

I am a small business owner, and I have forbidden my employees from flying EasyJet in the future. Not worth the hassle and a roll of the dice every trip..."|easyjet
450|"We booked this flight well in advance. I have never flown with easyJet and it was my first time traveling to and within Europe. Our flight was cancelled the morning of our flight and after talking to the easyJet staff we were told no flights would be available for the next 2 days including the day that we were intended to fly. The strange part was that there were other easyJet flights flying out of the same airport the same afternoon just a few hours after our flight was cancelled due to a ""strike"". We had reservations and plans booked in Venice in advance for this trip so we needed to get to our destination. There is NO travel insurance that will reimburse you for your cancelled flight unless the entire airport was shut down due to weather - that leaves it up the the airline. Travel insurance will also not reimburse you for costs incurred due to the cancelation and will not reimburse for reservations that were ruined as a result. There was no offered compensation or alternative option of travel offered by the airline. We were refunded the cost of our flight but that does not compare to that we needed to book tickets on an alternative airline which cost 9 fold. Pay 80$ now for a flight but pay 700$ at the door for an alternative flight with a different airline. Would you book with easyJet after this experience?

Pay the extra money to book with a different airline and save yourself a headache. My mistake was not doing the research with this airline. I was told by others that last minute flight cancelation happens frequently with easyJet. After an awesome weekend on the Amalfi coast this airline experience really felt like a kick in the gut nearly made me just want to go home and end my vacation early."|easyjet
451|"I had an upcoming trip booked abroad, for which I was SO excited. Unfortunately, two days before leaving, I got appendicitis and had to have emergency surgery. Of course, because of that, I had to cancel my entire trip.

Every hotel, hostel, train, and even the international flights helped us a lot by giving us refunds or credits. But not only did EasyJET not offer us a refund or a credit, they were incredibly rude about it.

While still hobbling around in pain and frustrated because I didn't get to go on my trip, their customer service representative told me, ""I do understand but this is not a terminal illness.""

Needless to say, I plan to never attempt to fly EasyJET again. It's not that I'm surprised that I couldn't get a refund, but I am very offended by how rude they were about it. It's enough to make me just take the train!"|easyjet
452|"You gotta know how to work that system. If you've ever flown Frontier, Spirit, or an equivalent ULTRA LOW COST carrier, you'll know what I mean.

Economy seats don't recline
Average leg room at most
Drinks and snacks cost money
Excess baggage is charged at a premium at the gate
No mobile check-in
Must print your boarding pass at home before arriving
Must pay to use the toilet (just kidding)

Easyjet will get you from point A to point B. Whether it's done on time is another story. Make sure your baggage fits inside the rectangular box or you'll be forced to check it at cost when they run out of room.

Do:
Buy extra leg room/early boarding seats
Arrive at the airport early. They won't wait for you once the boarding commences and are pretty quick at closing the gate
Clear customs and the border EARLY

English flight attendants are HOT. 11/10 will fly Easyjet again."|easyjet
453|"Easyjet is a fraudulent and unreliable airline. They promised to respond to my complaint within 28 days and of course never sent any further response. When I made my flight booking for Transavia and Easyjet flights through Kiwi.com, there was only one baggage purchase option at all, available only for 15 kg, which I purchased. There was no other purchase option on the website or at any time after. When I arrived at the airport, Easyjet charged me 90 Swiss Francs for my bag because it was 5kg beyond the limit (had I been informed of any issue in advance or that there was no way to pay the normal difference in fee, I would simply have brought a carry on bag, which easily would have fit 5kg).

The employee at Easyjet check in, Ehsan, and his manager, Suzanna, refused to wave or reduce the fee. But Ehsan directly and unequivocally admitted that Easyjet knew there were serious ongoing problem with the Kiwi website and that many customers had complained, but ""not enough"" for Easyjet to bother to do anything about it. (He laughed and said maybe if enough people took legal action something might change). He admitted explicitly there was no other way to purchase the larger baggage option on the Kiwi website, and that Kiwi did not offer the larger bag option at all (you would have to know you need to download a completely separate Easyjet app, and then use the app, which is not an option ever disclosed). Easyjet fully knew of this fraud and did absolutely nothing to address it, which means it is completely complicit. Ehsan also said I could have bought two separate bags at 15kg, which is absurd, as there is no way to know that Easyjet would allow you to combine them for single bag, and also would have been much more expensive than the larger bag option which was never made available. (I had the same issue with Transavia, but their employee was actually honest enough to acknowledge that Kiwi had created this known problem and not recharge me for the bag).

This is the legal definition of fraud--it means Easyjet is allowing and likely encouraging Kiwi to sell its tickets in a fraudulent manner so it can charge passengers exorbitant, extortionate amounts at check in. Easyjet has not responded at all. Kiwi and Easyjet have thousands of complaints against them that all demonstrate how deliberately deceptive their entire business models and operations are. Never fly on this airline."|easyjet
454|Terrible disgusting airline. Customer service is on the same level as a concentration camp. Will NEVER fly them again. They refused to let me onboard because I had a sprained ankle. Instead of helping me they caused so much stress that I ended up in the hospital. They're terrible horrible people DO NOT use them|easyjet
455|They have sub-standard baggage policy that catches passengers off guard, resulting in a baggage charge that is the equivalent of 50-80% of the airfare itself. Vueling on the other hand, also an European carrier, has a much more user-friendly policy that is consistent with international conventions and normal passenger expectations. Will try avoid this airline from now on.|easyjet
456|"I like EasyJet.

In fact I had 5 flights in one month and all of them went as smoothly as could be.

The staff are wonderful.  Even the people telling me my bags were overweight did it with a tinge of regret.

Everyone speaks excellent English.

For me I had to choose between trains with lots of luggage or quick 45 minute flights with not having to mess with suitcases.

Glad I flew EasyJet."|easyjet
457|"If there was such a thing to rate no stars at all no stars would be given. I've flown budget airlines before and never really had any problems until I flew with easyjet. By far the worse type of transportation there is! You would think because the name is ""easy""jet that it would make your life easier? No no no, not easy but complicated! They notified us that our flight is about 40 minutes delayed but we arrived at the airport early. Checked in early and even the person checking our bags said that the flight is delayed. Long story short, missed our flight and had to book another flight which wasn't until 9 hours. But that's not all... that flight was delayed for over 2 hours..... on the plane was some drunk loud men the whole plane ride back to London. Okay that's not all, when we arrived to Luton, there was only one guy working to check passports and they took one heck of a long time, by the time we reached to our baggage claim, my baggage was stolen... guesss what we went to the easyjet station and they were closed, asked multiple people for help but nope, they just kept pointing to every other direction. So we took down the number and email for easyjet. Emailed them regarding my missing luggage and til this day no reply. I honestly wished I rode the longer train ride back to London from Amsterdam but we live and we learn. So next time, never will be a next time flying with easyjet into Luton."|easyjet
458|By far the biggest airline scam I have ever dealt with. I initially booked a flight to Geneva from Barcelona but needed to abruptly change it as I had a sick relative with terminal cancer. I tried to change it within Easy Jet but they didn't have flights to accommodate my travel. I had to chat with a customer service representative named Nitish. Nitish was very polite and all that but they give you zero refund as well as ZERO CREDIT FOR FUTURE FLIGHTS. I have never dealt with any airline that just willingly keeps your money and tells you to screw yourself. This airline will not last long with policies like this. DO NOT BOOK WITH EASYJET!|easyjet
459|"I have been flying EasyJet for years, despite their flights being consistently late. I have had many delays plus even one canceled flight but I still stuck with them. But now I have had it.

Our flight from Bordeaux to Luton was five and a half hours late. The ground crew didn't even know why the plane was late. Then, I only received a text to the delay at the airport, 50 minutes AFTER the flight was supposed to take off. They provided a 'light refreshment' voucher of €9 which could only be spent at the sole food concession stand in the new Billi hall which was still under construction in Bordeaux. An average sandwich cost €5 and a bag of crisps €4!  This pretty much just added insult to injury as we were stuck eating this horrible food in a terminal that was essentially a shoddily constructed hangar outside the main airport.

We boarded at 10pm. I would have at least expected a free drink (it doesn't even need to be alcoholic!!) but they offered us nothing.

I never thought I would say this but I would rather fly Ryanair."|easyjet
460|"Wow, Easyjet and their staff at the Rome FCO airport are a joke. I needed to fly out of Rome to Paris on October 3rd, 2018. Our original flight was at 9:50 am for the same day.
It was at the airport that I realized I didn't have my passport. I went up to the Easyjet Informations desk at Rome FCO and explained to them that I do not have my passport and it most likely was left at the Hermes Boutique in Central Rome. At this time, it was only an assumption that my passport was with Hermes. This is because I received a missed call from a Rome number the night before. The next morning, I returned the missed call and I was sent straight to their Hermes voicemail. So at this point, all I knew was that I did not have my passport and that I have a missed call from Hermes meaning it is probably with them but I did not know for certain as no one picked up the phone. I wasn't going to get a definitive answer until 10:30 am which is when the boutique opened.

There were 2 people at the info desk- a man and a woman. I spoke to the man (did not get his name) about my situation and he said that it would be fine for me to go retrieve my passport from Hermes and come back and book a flight (fully knowing that my original flight was at 9:50 am and it would take me 2 hours round trip to get my passport from Hermes in Central Rome). He said that once I had my passport he can go ahead and book a new flight for me no problem, I just had to pay the difference. I went up to this man at least three times to make sure this would was the case. I wanted to make sure I knew everything I needed to know before leaving the airport and just wanted reassurance that there would be space available for me when I come back to book my flight to Paris. He said everything was fine, just go get my passport.
I get my passport, 2 hours later I am back at the airport and I go up to the Easyjet info desk. He is not there but the lady from the morning is and new girl named Julia. I spoke to Julia and she says there is nothing she can do and that I had to buy a completely new flight. I told her I had spoken to her colleague in the morning and he said I can pay the difference. She tells me that there is a 2 hours time window to be able the pay the difference for a flight, any later than that you have to buy a new flight. I tried to ask her understand my situation and that her colleague had told me otherwise. She would not change her mind. I end up agreeing to buy a new flight. She couldn't help me with buying a new flight and said I had to buy my flight myself either on my phone or on the airport computer. At this point I'm like, so you work at the Easyjet info desk which is to help consumers book/buy flights but you aren't able to help me with my flight....?? Seems like she's just making things up at this point. In any case, I buy my flight on my phone and realized I booked for Oct 04 instead of Oct 3. I go upstairs, told her I just booked the flight like 2 minutes ago but I booked for the wrong day, can she help me change the flight. Julia says that for her to change the flight Easyjet will keep 40-50 euros for the change (don't remember exactly but it was in the range). You can imagine how frustrated I was at this point. I compromise and purchase a new flight even though her colleague told me I would only have to pay the difference, I go and book my own flight because Julia, an Easyjet employee with a computer right in front her, says that she can't help me, and on top of that the they are charging me to change a flight that I literally had booked 2 minutes prior to talking to her. It just didn't make any sense. Nowhere did I read that there is a 2 hour time limit on booking a new flight. Nowhere did I see that Easyjet would keep a portion of what you had paid just to change the flight on top of paying a difference.
All I can say is DO NOT FLY THIS AIRLINE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. YOU ARE CHARGED FOR EVERY MINOR CHANGE/DETAIL. The employees are incompetent, inefficient, and most importantly DISHONEST. The customer service was absolutely horrid and honestly non-existent. Julia was not able to help me with anything but charge me more money.  Easyjet employees are a reflection of the company and after this experience with them, I advise anyone and everyone to take their time and money elsewhere. It's not worth it to fly this cheap airline."|easyjet
461|"Had two recent flights with EasyJet: Gatwick to Berlin (SXF), and Berlin (TXL) to Munich.

Gatwick to SXF:
- Boarding by stairs despite being assigned a gate with a jetway. This is commonplace for many low-cost airlines. However, simultaneous boarding from both the front and rear of the aircraft (based on seat assignments) created a chaotic scene onboard, and flight attendants didn't help much to handle the situation.
- Aircraft cabin was pretty clean, but was showing its age, with cracks in overhead bins, wear and tear in seats, and could use a much needed refurbishment.
- Seat pitch was very small, which is par for the course for many low-cost airlines. However, as I am tall, it was horrible for me, with next to no comfortable leg room, and my knees were touching the seat in front.
- Even worse, the seat did NOT recline whatsoever. It was in one fixed position.
- Service was standard low-cost, with no complimentary snacks or drinks. However, for a flight that was just under 2 hours, this wasn't TOO unbearable.
- Flight departed and arrived on time without any issues.

TXL to Munich:
- This was an EasyJet flight, with an EZY flight number. However, our aircraft was actually one of German airline Condor, painted in its color scheme, and had a Condor crew. Instead of an Airbus A320 which would normally operate EasyJet flights, we got a Boeing 757.
- According to EasyJet, this was the result of an arrangement with partners such as Condor and Thomas Cook to operate flights from TXL on behalf of EasyJet, while the airline is in the process of establishing a major hub at TXL.
- While the crew sounded rather apologetic for this, I personally found it an upgrade from being in an actual EasyJet aircraft.
- The biggest difference I noticed, and appreciated, was the much better seat pitch on Condor. Did not feel cramped at all. Also nice was the fact that the seat could recline.
- The aircraft appeared better maintained.
- Boarding, again done by stairs, was much more orderly and organized. However, this may be due to the relatively light load of the flight (only appeared to be about 50% full), compared to the full load on the Gatwick to SXF flight.
- Again, no complimentary snacks and drinks offered, but the flight was barely an hour long, so this was not an issue for me.
- The departure was delayed by about 20 minutes due to de-icing of the plane, but the crew communicated well regarding this.

All in all, EasyJet is what you would expect for a low-cost airline. If you can handle no-frills and seats with small pitch and no recline, you should be fine. The seat issues I mentioned can become a real pain for some people, though.

Be aware that EasyJet does not do check-in at the airport. You can only check in online. Their desks at the airport are for bag drop, and it may be possible to be issued a boarding pass there, but I would still highly recommend checking in online and printing a boarding pass in advance.

Also, if your flight departs or arrives at TXL, the plane may not necessarily be an EasyJet one. While this ended up being a good thing for me, it may very well depend on the airline and aircraft."|easyjet
462|They STOLE my money!  I pre-paid for more than 15kg weight for 5 bags as we were on vacation and did not have a scale. I was told by them to do this online as the cost at the airport the day of flight was more. This cost $180 Euros.  When we got to the airport 4 bags were under 15kg and 1 bag was 15.2 kg.  They owed me $160.00 Euros.  I asked the ticketing agent to credit my credit card and was told that I'd have to do it online.  Guess what?  NOPE!!!  They told me I would not get a credit and too bad...read the fine print on baggage refunds.  They STOLE my money and the ticketing agent was complicit in the theft!!  Stay away from them!!|easyjet
463|I would like to recommend them, but they canceled a flight that almost caused me to miss a transatlantic flight. I literally made my flight by minutes. They are required to offer compensation by the EU. They have stalled and stalled and I have yet to receive over $600 dollars they agreed I was owed for alternate transportation I had to arrange myself. The flight took place 8 months ago. Their FB page has numerous similar complaints. For that reason I would not recommend them.|easyjet
464|Bargain price- good service. It is an inexpensive airline, was slightly late, but I got to Prague in one piece on a rather raucous flight. The seats did not recline, but it was less than 2 hours from Gatwick to Prague.  Under 200 bucks- still a good deal. The attendants were great. You do get what you pay for, and I got there less than an hour late. EasyJet is the gateway to Europe- bring a little patience and get there safely, and dirt cheap. Its worth it if you are looking to get there safely on a budget.|easyjet
465|What a bottom feeding airline. They'll look for any reason to gauge - good example them saying my bag was about 1mm too big, and then charging  £50 for each leg, 100 total, as a surcharge on the £88 ticket. It would have been cheaper to go with a legitimate airline.|easyjet
466|"We had a flight booked from London Luton to Paris and right when we got to the airport we were told the flight had been cancelled. Also we found out that the next flight would not leave until two days later. My first thought was you have got to be kidding me. Also we found out there were no flights to Paris leaving that night from any airport in London. Double ""Are you kidding me,"" London is a big city and it is only 6 pm. Called me spoiled, but this would not happen in the US. Anyway, the Easy Jet representative told us that we would be reimbursed for our extra hotel night stay, transportation to the airport and new flights, but we would have to pay upfront. Also this push back all the reservations we had made for the rest of our trip. There was nothing else we could do. We were not the only ones put out by this incompetence. Flights were also cancelled to Amsterdam and Spain. How can you play with people's lives like this?"|easyjet
467|"I went online to change the return portion of a ticket, I discovered within 5 min that I made a mistake,  There was no number to call to correct the error.  Once I managed to chat with their customer service, they said that they 24 hours refund policy does not cover ticket changes - so beware!!!!

Trying to make extra money of people honest mistake should not be acceptable business practice.  Other airlines in the past were much more understanding so - don't fly easy jet."|easyjet
468|Such a horrible airline. If there was half a star I would choose that. The service was terrible, overbooked, made many people buy a second plane ticket, just a damn nightmare honestly. Not worth the low price.|easyjet
469|"I genuinely never go out of my way to leave bad reviews, but I feel obligated to share what an awful and terrible experience I had with this airline. The morning of my flight with easyjet nine people including myself were denied entry to the plane and were forced to buy a plane ticket for the following day, also having to spend money on a hotel for the night, all because this airline overbooked its flights for the day. This cheap airline does not care at all about its passengers, will not call anyone to the gate, will not post the gate number until the last minute, and will not help you once you ""miss the flight"" despite not making it clear how to arrive to the gate. This is a huge con.

Not to mention, customer service for this airline was incredibly rude.

Many people in the customer service line were complaining of the same thing: not being able to board their flight. They made a massive amount of money from customers who had no choice but to buy another plane ticket.

I will never in my life use this airline and no one should. For the low rate you receive terrible service and massive headache that's not worth the ""savings"". If you even get on the plane."|easyjet
470|They tagged several travelers for having a carry on and a purse but out of 6 or 7 people I was the ONLY one that was charged!  On top of that they WROTE DOWN MY CREDIT CARD NUMBER instead of processing it electronically.  Discrimination at it's worst and potential fraud!  Service agents were rude to almost everyone they encountered.  Some travelers were quite upset.  Just because your cheap doesn't entitle you to be rude and disrespectful.|easyjet
471|Maybe my least favorite airline... ever!  Avoid at all cost. Why is there no stars option for this airline? Nickel and dime you for everything. Terrible terrible terrible terrible airline|easyjet
472|This airline should be investigated and shut down, they are CRIMINALS. Canceling flights at will, leaving passengers stranded on the plane. The next day on our rebooked flight, they moved the flight forward without notice, despite the flight not having taken off, we were denied passage. This had a huge knock-on effect, that took 4 hrs to rectify and huge expense and stress. Again, avoid these criminals at all cost, it's cheap no doubt, but buyer beware ... you get what you pay for in life.|easyjet
473|"A surrealistic AWFUL experience! I arrived at the London Luton airport at 5:50 a.m. for my 6:55 a.m. flight, which should give me plenty of time to do the check-in and security process. BUT, some Easyjet employee there at the check-in desk just printed my boarding pass wrong ( only had half of the barcode on it), I couldn't get through the entry gate. Therefore, I was sent back and forth between the entry gate and the check-in desk (yes, the staffs there were friendly, but really not helping at all. They were just been nice and kicking you around).
That wrong boarding pass thing wasted me a lot of time. So not surprisingly, I missed my flight. When I spoke to one of their employees try to get my flight re-scheduled, he told me that my boarding pass was re-printed at 6:13, the gate closure was at 6: 40, SO I should have made the flight. Well, I was wondering how he thought 27 mins would be enough for me to get through all the people lined up there at the security check, Not to mention that I could have plenty of time if they just didn't print my boarding pass wrong!!!!!
Also he told I have to pay extra 80 pounds for a tomorrow's flight! That's really outrageous, I haven't yet even asked them to refund my waste of time and my ruined trip!!! I had no choice but paid them the 80 pounds for the next flight.
I've filed the claim on their website, hopefully I can get my refund and also cover my extra day of hotel expense.
But I saw someone says that they are not honest with refunds? If anyone know how I can I make sure they gonna give me my refund, please help me, Thank you !!"|easyjet
474|"I arrived at Gatwick to check-in for a flight to Lisbon to be told that the flight was oversold and the next available flight was 31 hours later.  In the US when I buy a ticket I get on the plane; the airline bribes others to give up their seats. EasyJet doesn't do this, nor will it rebook you on other airlines.

With EasyJet you are not booking a seat on a flight, you are buying a lottery ticket with a chance of getting a seat on a flight. That is not the way I want to travel.

You then get in a Customer Service line for hours and are told to go online to ask for a refund, with the promise that they will respond in 21 days.

I was left feeling like a piece of meat. EasyJet has no concept of customer service and is a disgrace to the travel industry."|easyjet
475|"STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS AIRLINE!!

My flight was delayed 17 HOURS.

Yes, you read that correctly. 17 HOURS!! My flight was supposed to get me into Naples around 9pm on the 21st. Of course, we had prepaid for a hotel for the evening of the 21st in Naples which was NON REFUNDABLE. Basically, I was out $300. I assumed that EasyJet would cover this expense since it was their fault I reached my destination a full 17 hours after the promised time. Boy was I wrong. They have not offered a THING. Not a dime. Not even a refund of my flight cost. They have not accommodated us for the tremendous inconvenience in any capacity whatsoever.

If you value your money or getting to your destination on time, STAY. AWAY. It is not worth the cheap ticket price- you will end up wasting tons of money and time!!

The worst customer service I have ever experienced in ALL my years of traveling. I fly AT LEAST once a month for work and have never experienced such completely unsatisfactory service and response."|easyjet
476|"This has one star because I couldn't give negatives ! This airline is a joke.. it's only one bag allowed (that INCLUDES purses and book bags) the flight people are rude and very in helpful! My flight was delayed 3 hours !! And my friends seat canceled !!

If you are an international travel with plans of getting back to your continent such as I did, DO NOT TAKE THE RISK. you always get what you pay for !! They rack you up in fees and give no insight on what's going on.

LOVE YOURSELF AND PAY THE EXTRA MONEY FOR A BETTER AIRLINE ! you won't regret it"|easyjet
477|"First time flying Easy Jet and I was not impressed at all. Flying from London to Paris I was not told at check in I was only aloud one bag. While boarding I was told to put my backpack into my suitcase. Due to putting my backpack into my suitcase I had to hold all my chargers, camera, computer, wallet, etc in my lap.

If you are looking for an airline that allows you to have a bag and a carry on suitcase I would NOT recommend Easy Jet."|easyjet
478|"NOT A RESPONSIBLE AIRLINES

I paid for a ticket, when i got to BCN airport and was told I have to stand by, because the flight was over sold. why I should take responsibility for their activities? it is so weird.
the most weird thing is: they do not take any actions to cover the over-sold, they do not broadcast volunteers who's schedule are move flexible, I did not know they pick me up randomly or because I arrive at airport later than others? when I approached to their counter and asking they why they do not ask volunteers to change flight, they answers that was their company's rules.
so rush fast to get your seats, no matter if you have fully paid for your tickets or not.
otherwise, choose other airlines!"|easyjet
479|"WARNING::::Very unprofessional. Airline does not care about you. Its all about the almighty dollar $$$$ for them. We arrived late due to departing late out of USA.  When we approached the customer service desk the first thing they said it's too bad its not our fault. You are going to have to purchase new tickets for each of you (8) then they looked over their counter and said "" it's going to cost you for those bags especially the they big ones.""  They will be $100.00 each. So much for helping out their customers.  I would definitely WARN any one and everyone NOT to fly on this Airline. My rating is minus 3 stars ."|easyjet
480|Not a bad service for the price. Larger allowance on cabin baggage ( didn't have to take the wheels off) and slightly cheaper food and drinks onboard. Friendly service and not too long hanging around before boarding.|easyjet
481|"First, there is not option but to put a star. They deserve nothing from me. We flew from Frankfurt to Barcelona, one stop in Paris. The whole family traveled with 4 carry for a 19 days vacation in Europe. We were asked to pay €140 for baggage. Each piece of luggage weighted less than 11kg - 24 pounds!! Then, the explanation on the baggage ticket could paymbe interpreted like it baggage payment covered roundtrip. It didn't. We ended up at paying €280-US$420 for 45kg-99lbs. I was so mad!! We know they are cheap and we didn't care about snack on flight but this can ruin someone's vacations. I understand they have smaller planes but people fly from everywhere so they must warn you in BIG PRINT the size of their carry on that is 50x40x20 cm.  That is my son's backpack for 1st. Grade.... empty.
Never again. We are done with EasyJet."|easyjet
482|Easy-Jet:From Rome to Nice  it was easy to check in ,we missed calculated the weight of our luggage and was charge extra for the weight which was understandable .The agent I found was very friendly and helpful he was trying to lower the price of the overweight. Our flight was delayed  about 20 minutes no big deal. The aircraft was a very roomy AirBus the seat were more plain a thinner type of non-reclining but plenty of leg room the row was wider. The overhead compartments were large and first time on a flight there was room for all our carry-on's . The flight crew were very friendly and young ladies flight attendants were the most attractive young ladies they should be models.  As the is a no thrilled flight you have to pay for your pop and snack etc. Arriving in Nice our luggage was off the plane a few minute after us and no damage . I like Easy-Jet and would fly them again .|easyjet
483|"They changed the airport of our flight and didn't inform
us in any way(no email, text etc). We learned this only after reaching the airport. They offered us another flight which was 5 hours later and at another airport in Rome. An entire precious day wasted. We couldn't do much in Rome as we were supposed to fly at 3. The only option was to rot at the airport for 5 hours! Never flying this airline again."|easyjet
484|"Dealing with customer service has been far from easy. Worst airline customer service I have ever dealt with. Our flight was delayed multiple times without an explanation, then at around midnight, we were told that it was cancelled. People at the customer service desk weren't communicative but eventually told us that there were no other flights out until four days from our original departure date. We were then asked to book flights through other airline companies and were told that we would be reimbursed for the full cost of the flight we booked. It's been well over a month since my claim was approved, and I am STILL waiting on the $500 that was apparently refunded to my account. In addition, I called customer service (which cost me money) and they were absolutely useless. The lady on the phone basically said, ""It says refund processed on your account, so I can't really help you with this. You can email customer service and they will be able to help you."" In the past, airline companies that have cancelled a flight have sent me a voucher of sorts to apologize for the inconvenience. Should have known not to expect that from such a terrible, budget airline."|easyjet
485|"Booking alone was miserable. Wanted to book a one way, took forever to figure out how to...spoiler alert: on the last page....you just have to pretend you will fly back for most of the booking and then at the last minute cancel that flight....

Speaking of cancellations.....i tried to cancel said flight in less that 24 hours (spoiler alert #2, you can't do it online, you have to call easy jet - you'll have to google their phone number because its not on their website) and got a whole 14 pounds back as my refund......hahahaha! really? Less that 24 hours and you cant cancel it like every other airline? I asked if they every give full refunds...the customer service rep was very honest and gave me a NO as an answer.

Not worth it. Too much hassle and work and stress and reviews are pretty horrible...i'd rather pay the extra 50 to be stress free"|easyjet
486|"Without doubt the worst flight experience of our lives.

I am not one to leave bad reviews, and would not consider myself, or my husband, a difficult customer to deal with. However, this horrific experience with EasyJet absolutely ruined our trip, and cost us a great deal of emotional stress and additional expenses!!
My husband and I were on our way to Switzerland to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary. We went to the Clapham Junction station 3 hours before our flight to get a train to Gatwick Airport. Upon arrival, all trains to Gatwick were suspended due to a suicide on the train tracks. We left the station with another couple in the same situation and called an Uber, but the ETA was 15 minutes before our flight took off. We then returned to the station to see if there was any update, or if a train service had resumed, but all trains were still suspended. We then called EasyJet to explain the situation and tell them that there was no possible way we could make our flight, as there was no way of getting out to Gatwick on time. We asked if there was any other flight we could get on, but they said there was nothing they could do for us. So, we asked for a refund or credit of the outbound flight. When we were told a full refund was not possible, we settled on a refund of the taxes for our first flight. After numerous times of trying to get them to see that we were in a situation that we had no control over, the operator said the best they could do was refund the tax paid on the outbound flight, which equated to 26 pounds... very generous of them, wow! The sadness of the situation definitely helped put things in perspective, but such an incident is comparable to that of a natural disaster. It was completely out of our hands and we had no way of making our flight, regardless of how hard we tried.

This resulted in us purchasing a later flight from London City Airport, with Swiss airlines, costing us an additional $280.05. We had an all day tour already purchased for the following early morning in Switzerland, and had to get there Friday evening. Not the best start to our 1 year wedding anniversary :-(

That Sunday evening, we arrived at the airport for our return flight back to Gatwick airport with EasyJet. We scanned in and went through security as normal, without any issues.  The flight was delayed by an hour, not boarding until 10:30pm, so we waited in the lounge area. When the plane began boarding, my husband and I went up to the counter to have our boarding passes scanned. When we arrived at the counter, our boarding passes repeatedly failed to scan through. At this stage, we have our boarding passes ready, booking confirmation, seat number, flight number etc, yet our passes won't scan through. The airline attendants are trying repeatedly, but they won't scan. They pull us aside and say that our payment must have not gone through. We know our payment went through, so my husband pulls up the receipt + email confirmation on his phone to show the flight attendants. Now they are confused/flustered, as are we, and are calling their headquarters to find out why we are not in the system. The airline attendant then tells us that the easyJet agent we spoke to with regards the refund for our outbound flight, had completely REMOVED US FROM THEIR SYSTEM and cancelled our return flight! We explained to the airline attendants that we NEVER asked for a refund for our return flight, we wanted to keep our return flight, and had only requested a refund for our outbound flight. The whole flight has been boarded by now, and the airline attendants are telling us that they can't let us on the flight because it has been fully booked, and the next flight out to London won't be until Monday!
To the airline attendants credit, they were just as upset as we were, and couldn't believe the agent from EasyJet would make such a MASSIVE error! This meant we had to purchase ANOTHER flight for the next day, Monday morning, so we could get home....Yes, this is now the 4th flight we had to buy for a 3 day trip!!
Not only is this seriously affecting us cost wise, but I had just started a new job and had to cancel all my classes that I was supposed to teach on that Monday. This has now significantly affected my work standing, and I also received no pay for that day. Not to mention the stress the situation caused at a time when we should have been celebrating our 1 year wedding anniversary.
Since returning, we have reported the situation to Easyjet, who said they would investigate it further and get back to us within 3-5 days. It has now been 7 days and we still have not heard anything back. Overall, this was an incredibly stressful and disappointing experience with Easyjet. The complete lack of empathy and desire to fix a situation that has caused two of their customers such a significant amount of financial and emotional stress. Please be wary using this airline."|easyjet
487|"They is not many airlines, I would avoid people to avoid at all costs, so much so that you should pay more not to fly with them, but Easyjet is that airline.

The first time I flown with them was to Madrid from Liverpool and back, towards the end of July 2014 I had a flight over to Madrid and everything was very good however my return flight was the worst flight of my life!

Originally the flight was delayed, what I found out was due to aircraft maintenance, after calling us to the gate this was unsettling, especially with the aircraft looking like it was struggling to set off and making a funny noise most of the way their.

That isn't all of it! I wanted a nice, gluten free meal, I originally tried the soup but I found that watery and horrible on my flight to Madrid but on the way back to Liverpool, I noticed cous-cous on the menu, so I pointed it out and asked if it was gluten free. The Stewardess told me it was, I didn't think she checked because she quickly gave it to me, she had made it and when I looked at the packaging I saw it contained 65% wheat.

For a big airline at easy jet to make a mistake like this what could of gave me some nasty symptoms, I am shocked and I have given 1 star for less serious cases than this but  Easy jet defiantly deserves 1 star, even less, worse yet they did not reply to the letter I sent them and hung up on me after I phoned their customer service line!"|easyjet
488|"I probably would have forgotten to review them - again - but it is time to memorialise the, umm, service I received on EasyJet.

On this outing, I headed to Italy. The booking process was no problem. I got the flight times I wanted and seating on the return flight. The seating on the outward bound is where I had an issue.

Oh, I booked in an emergency seating row - no problem, I'm ok with that - what I am not ok with is what occurred in that row and surrounding rows.

I purchased some food to take on-board (as so many of us do) and I had done this previously. No problem you say. Well, EasyJet staff say different...at least to me they did.

While waiting for take-off, I had my bag (BAG -not box, crate or small whale) in my lap. I noticed many travellers around me had bottles of water and food also in their laps. Also the couple seated next to me with 2 bags of fruit, books and water bottles - all in their laps. Hmmm...staff came through to advise me I could not have the bag on my lap in that row. Really? Well, I waited for her to tell my neighbours the same but she did not. I said it's only a sandwich. She said nothing can be in your lap or under the seat in this row. My neighbours and surrounding passengers continued munching, drinking (some not, just holding items in their lap). What was going on here? Why was my 1 sandwich bag an issue but the smorgasbord around me was ok? She did not move. Told me I had to find overhead space to stow it. I said I would put it in the front seat pocket and she was ok with that. Why? Why was that ok yet she moved right on down the line without even a glance at the other passengers with the same if not more items on their laps; especially those two next to me - also in the emergency exit row and they were nearest the window!?!

I am always leery of EasyJet because they are not consistent. With anything!

Did I mention, she also had an issue with my jumper that I put on the floor at my feet? Yes, my neighbour had a jumper which he took off and put on his lap but nothing was said about that. I was told to stow my jumper or put it on.

Make of this review what you will. I make it out to be rude, inconsistent if not, downright unfair, umm, service. I bet if they read this review they won't even find anything noteworthy in it.

491|"I just flew Easyjet for the first time and will never fly it again.

On my way to Europe I paid in advance for a checked bag. I flew from the US  to London to Italy. I flew another airline from the US to London and when I landed I went to my new gate  to board my Easyjet flight. The gate agent told me I'd need to re-pay for my checked bag since I was handing it to her at the gate. I explained I had arrived from an international flight and had not been outside of security. I was forced to pay $65 anyway. It's a ridiculous policy to expect that I would go through immigration and customs to get outside airport security to drop off my pre-paid bag and go back through security to make my flight.

On my return flight I took only one bag with me. I wasn't sure I should check it or if I could carry it on so I spoke with the ticketing agent who said no need to check it, it's a fine size for carry on. When I arrived at the gate I was told my bag was too large for a carry-on. I explained I had asked the ticketing agent about my bag and had been told the size was fine, but the gate agent charged me anyway. I had to pay an additional $68 to check my bag!

If you are trying to save money Easyjet might be a nice option but honestly I had to pay over $150+ in bag fees and for that kind of cash I should've just booked with a real airline. Lesson learned."|easyjet
492|Exorbitant fees for baggage at airport and inability to resolve customer service issues on site. Nothing was easy.|easyjet
493|Wish I could give no stars.  Worst experience ever.  After overbooking our flight, easyjet made us wait hours to even address a possible rebooking.  Claiming our tickets would be refunded as well as a $250 compensation for our hotel, I have yet to hear anything from them.  I filled out a compensation form online and have been dodged ever since.  Worst Airline EVER!|easyjet
494|"Stelios Haji-Ioannou's EasyJet started the whole budget airline craze in the UK. His airline has expanded massively and despite him no longer being at the helm of the business, it continues to hold a strong brand identity in this country

I'm glad to say that they now fly from Gatwick, which is much more convenient for me than their original Luton hub. They do fly from both North and South terminals for those new to using EasyJet at Gatwick, just in case you're panicking that you can't see your flight on the check in or departure boards. There's a fast monorail link between the 2 terminals

My main beef with Easyjet is that I don't really consider them a budget airline as I've never got a cheap flight with them despite trying sometimes to book months ahead. Those headline prices have proven very elusive for me

As is typical for budget airlines, everything is extra - checked baggage, early boarding, paying by credit card. However, I like EasyJet more than RyanAir because RyanAir's chief executive treats his passengers with rude and open contempt.

There is no assigned seating, so I suggest getting to the gate early if it matters a lot to you to sit together or in a particular seat. Refreshments are available at a price on board

Oh and you had better not have a phobia of the colour orange if you fly with them!"|easyjet
495|"Just dont

i ordered tickets for a weekend trip to london, easyjet were cheaper than the other airlines but not by much. with easyjet you have to pay sxtra for luggage and they land out i Gatwick.
after paying for luggage and the trip in to london it ended up being more expensive than flying sas on the same trip.
in my opinion the service are very low and, there are very short distance between the seats so as a 185 cm i were severely cramped, both planes were delayed.
the way easy jet cut costs are trough the airport handling, the worse the gate the cheaper flight.

in cph you have to walk 20 min to get to the easy jet gates and coming back the you have to walk the same way and then head to the furthest baggage carousel.

in my experience easyjet isnt easy and when comparing prices remember to take the additional costs in to account. it ended up being more expensive than a trip with sas or ba who have a lot better service"|easyjet
496|We got the classic bait and switch carrying our bags onto the plane. Paid extra so we could bring standard-sized carry-on bags on board, were told they were fine when we checked in, but when we got to the gate were told one of them was too big. Because we were forced to check at the gate they charged an extra fee, so the $80 to check the bag was almost more than the cost of the ticket. What a racket. What's worse, when I contacted them to complain they simply replied (after weeks of waiting and multiple contact attempts) that this was standard policy. To rip people off? Guess so. The flight itself made us feel like we were living in an infomercial with the flight attendants selling all kinds of junk up and down the aisles and even a soft drink costing money.|easyjet
497|"If only you could give zero stars. avoid avoid avoid. Even if you think this is the cheapest option. it is not, because you pay in the end for the terrible service and extras. Getting a glass of water appears to be too much effort for the staff.

You seriously get what you pay for. Plus bonus stuff, like gate staff yelling at you to board, to make sure your bag is the right size, to board at the rear or the front, etc. When I say yell, I meant it. Every one was barking orders. They are not gently encouraging you. They are rude. And I do not blame the staff they are just following orders from above - product of the policy put in place to try and maximize profit. I blame management and stakeholders who have decided that their interest is much more important than their customers.

I have flown a lot and taken a lot of cheaper carriers but easyjet is the worst airline I have EVER flown. The policies they have developed to make things ""easy"" (check-in online, 1 cabin bag, strict boarding times) do the opposite and forces staff to be a-holes. Both of my fights were behind schedule which makes me happy because typically the airlines get fined for a delayed departure.

As of August 2013 they do not even have a kiosk to print out your boarding pass (you cannot use the app at Gatwick). So what does easyjet have at Gatwick (south term) ONE person behind a desk. And that person was told by easyjet management to be an a-hole to people who need their b-passes printed.

The best part of my return flight to CPH was when John (easyjet) on the plane was aggressively rearranging cabin luggage and dropped an umbrella on a guy below. It hit the passenger square on the top of his head. No apology. no question of are you alright? Nope John was just annoyed he had to rearrange the cabin luggage. unreal."|easyjet
498|The terrible policy of ONE bag per passenger carry-on (and that means ONE) is so absurd, so thoughtless, and created such anxiety for the passengers on our two flights last month. It was really inexcusable. We saw one passenger DESTROY the zipper on their suitcase in a desperate effort to reduce the carry-on to ONE. Mind you there is plenty of space to place one item under the seat and one reasonable item above. But for some reason this foolish airline chooses to abuse their clients. We saw one passenger, in a failing effort to reduce the length on his suitcase by one inch KICK the wheels off his suitcase, plastic debris flying everywhere at the EasyJet gate, passengers either frightened at the violence or cheering him on. I would never fly EasyJet again if I had a good choice. There is NO generosity from this airline whatsoever.|easyjet
499|I will never fly with this airline again. It looks cheap to start, but they charge you for everything, so you end up paying just as much as you would have flying with a decent airline. On my flight out of London, I was told (not when checking my bag, but at the gate) that only 1 carry on item was allowed. Not a carry on and a personal item, but one item total. They charged me an additional $60 for it! Terrible airline!|easyjet
500|Terrible experience with this airline! I had a cancelled flight 3 months ago and they still have not given me my refund. Horrible customer service, no direct contacts or responses to email. If I could give 0 stars I most definitely would!|easyjet
501|"In no way does EasyJet compare with JetBlue. JetBlue is a million times better!

I flew EasyJet from Berlin to Luton. I couldn't check-in online despite repeated attempts. I found out when I got to the airport that I couldn't check-in because the plane had too few seats for the number of passengers so they were kicking people off. I got put on a flight several hours later.

But the worse part was the follow-up. I emailed to get the EU required refund. No reply so I call and after giving them my credit card number, was told I didn't need to do anything further. Days later I get an email saying they again needed the last four digits of my credit card. I send it but nothing happens. Two weeks later I get a voicemail saying I should call. As every call is an international one that costs money, I emailed. No reply. Weeks later, I email again. They say they have been trying to contact me?? Not a single email in my box.

Only after I write months later, do they tell me they had problems processing the refund on my card - that's true because I had to cancel my card when my husband misplaced it. But why didn't they process it right away the first time? And why don't they tell me they had problems until months later when I write back to them???

I call again, give a credit card number. Nothing. I email multiple times.

Now it's been almost a year and I still don't have the refund."|easyjet
502|I contacted them via their social media website and finally got a response by someone who was not from easyjet's super incompetent customer service team.  After looking into our case (took them about two weeks), they FINALLY refunded our money.  It took them from June 2013-February 2014 to refund us the amount they had initially promised us.  I think they should really look into investing in a better customer service team.|easyjet
503|"We bought two tickets to fly out of Rome, Italy to Athens, Greece in June because we were celebrating our honeymoon.  We were so excited to be going to Greece.  When we arrived at the fiumicino airport, the manager Fabrizio, said that they canceled our flight because they had overbooked it.  He reassured us that if we found another flight out, EasyJet would compensate us.  They would also refund us and give us some compensation for the trouble we experienced.  He said that this process would be very smooth and easy.  We frantically stood in line trying to find another flight out because we had already booked our hotel stay in Athens.  Fabrizio said that EasyJet couldn't help us because there were no available flights for the next couple of days.  he said that the airline would pay for our hotel stay if we decided to stay in Rome.

This all seemed acceptable for us because they said that we would be compensated for our new trip through a different airline.  After 4 hours waiting at the airport, we found a flight to Athens through Bulgaria Air (excellent airline).  After our trip, we began the process to get refunded for our denied boarding.  At first, they didn't want to give us any compensation for our troubles, even though he promised this to us.  THEY DIDN'T EVEN REFUND US FOR THE FLIGHT THAT WE NEVER TOOK.  After 4 months of trying to get our money back through calling and writing them, we finally got refunded for the flight and some money for the delays.  HOWEVER THEY REFUSED TO REIMBURSE US FOR OUR BULGARIA AIR FLIGHT EVEN THOUGH THE MANAGER CLEARLY WROTE OUT WHAT WE WOULD BE RECEIVING.  FOR GOODNESS SAKES, HE EVEN SIGNED HIS NAME ON THE DOCUMENT.  We still haven't gotten our money back.  A representative said that their policy prevented them for reimbursing us so the matter is closed.  This was a nightmare.  When they cancel your flight, don't expect them to honor the promises that they make.  Even though their company offers cheap flights, don't take the deal.  They have very shady business practices. When their customer service representative promises that they will call you back, don't expect them to do so."|easyjet
504|"Yay!

I've flown Easyjet many times and prefer it over Ryanair (my other go-to cheap airline when I'm bouncing around Europe). Though the bright orange uniforms of the staff are quite offensive on the eyes, the employees are so friendly and helpful and I've never had any issues. I always find the Easyjet staff to be much more friendly and nicer than the Ryanair staff.

I've never paid more than $40 (I always take the conversion rates into consideration) for a flight which is pretty amazing, considering it seems like that's how much we pay to even be allowed to use an airline website in the U.S. (exaggeration of course). That being said, I've always booked way in advance and shopped around for the cheapest destinations. My typical routine: I'll find a cheap flight from the U.S. to somewhere in Europe (usually London or Dublin) and then shop around the discount airlines for cheap flights to any interesting city and I'll design my itinerary around those cheap flights. I'm sure I might have more complaints about the costs if I always had a destination in mind. I also never fly with more than 1 carry on (that's just my low-maintenance travel technique) so I haven't had to deal with luggage fees either.

It is a bit of a mad rush when it comes time to board, especially when people don't know how to queue up properly, but you get what you pay for, right? Just show up early so you can get a spot at the front of the line and everything will be okay, I promise."|easyjet
505|"Budget European airlines are definitely no frills.  If you want to fly cheaply around Europe, you definitely need to try EasyJet.  I took EasyJet from Switzerland to Germany to Netherlands to the Czech Republic and to the UK.  

Seating is first come first serve and everything is an extra frill.  Want food, pay extra.  Want to get on board first before the cattle call? You've got to pay extra.  

Some of the departure/arrival times are really bad.  They're either super early in the morning or super late at night.  My arrival into Gatwick from the Prague was at 10 PM.  

The great part of EasyJet was that flights were never late and the pricing is unbeatable.  I'm glad for that because if you're flying around Europe, your flight times are only about 2 hours in length anyway."|easyjet
506|"Vienna - London Gatwick route: I suppose you get what you pay for....Low cost, no frills flights. But I didn't think this would also apply to the staff. The service at London Gatwick was terrible. A little enthusiasm wouldn't go amiss. I was also very shocked by the staff's attitude on the departure gate: rude and abrupt would explain it. And she had the nerve to ask ME if I had a problem. I don't think this accusatory approach is the right way to communicate with a customer.

The cabin crew were also miserable for the whole flight as well and I saw eye-rolling between them when a customer was asking for something which is unprofessional.

Maybe EasyJet announced loads of job cuts the day I flew which made them all really angry?!?! I don't know but every member of EasyJet staff I came across that day was moody, miserable or rude. I wouldn't normally be so picky but good customer service should be a priority.

Normally my pet peeve with EasyJet is that they never run on time and are always delayed but no, the bad staff dominate this review. If the route and price weren't so convenient from Vienna I wouldn't choose them. Having said that, I used to be a regular flyer on the Paris CDG - Newcastle route and delays were my only problem just so you know I am not writing this against ALL EasyJet staff ;)"|easyjet
507|I checked EasyJet flight in seatguru.com and was surprised EasyJet is using Airbus 319 airplane! Seat pitch was limited but OK. There is also the option to pay 12 € extra charge for getting an extra large seat for legs! These seats are there where emergency exit is. Price I paid wasn't different from price other airline companies as it was a short term booking! Airplane food was OK and service was friendly.|easyjet
508|First of all it's inexpensive to fly EasyJet and therefore don't expect a lot! This airline is a genius concept! It was an urgent case and we needed to immediately fly back home. Well! EasyJet offered us best flight schedule + price! We were lucky to find a quiet check-in desk far from overwhelming group travel passengers! High number business travelers flying EasyJet was really surprising to see! We luckily had whole row seats for us but nevertheless we felt very uncomfortable because there was not enough space for legs! Seat pitch was very bad! I suffered and had legs + back pains! A good thing I could order Starbucks hot chocolate and blueberry muffin during this short flight! Service was very friendly! EasyJet is using in most European cities airports which are very far from downtown.|easyjet
509|This airline is cheap and cheerful.  Staff are friendly.  Clean inside as well.  Only thing I don't like about Easy Jet is that you have to pay extra to take luggage on with you and that you don't get to see a film whilst flying and you have to pay extra to eat or drink on the plane. So after paying all that might as well just pay and go on a different airline with everything included.|easyjet
510|Worst airline ever! Do not book a flight here. They get you with the less expensive airfare and get you by making you check all your bags in for more than the airfare you pay. My daughters bag completely fit in the size check with exception to 1 side of the wheel. We were forced to check it. By the time we checked in the bags which fit in every airline overhead (small as well) we flew in Europe, we could have flown a more reputable airline where they would not force you to check your carry on bag.|easyjet
511|It's cheap and I normally don't complain when you get what you spend. But attempting to hassle and make people pay for luggage that is normal for one to bring on a plane is stupid. Humans aren't sardines I wouldn't ride with them if your above 200lbs or you will be highly uncomfortable. I wouldn't complain had it only been one bad experience but I've flown with them twice and learnt my lesson not to do it a third time. Customer service needs some work and that's from telephone in person and email. Also if your boarding a flight in London England it would be great if the employees could speak English|easyjet
512|"One sentence! Do not fly this airline!
Worst airline ecxperiance ever! We had to pay 90 Euro to check in 2 pieces of luggage which converts into 101$ in USA. Thats highway robbery!
Plus we delt with unpleasant customer service, who threatened to revoke our tickets for not wanting to pay the 90 euro for our luggage.
Once onboard, you had to pay for everything, drinks were 1.50/2 euros and food was more.  
I dont know how this airline stays in business! We will never fly this airline again!"|easyjet
513|"After reading all of the negative review about Easyjet I felt kinda bad about piling on with another. Ok that feeling is over. How do the terms unprofessional, biased, unfair, flea market, infomercial, did I say unprofessional and rude. My wife, son and myself flew from Roma to Gatwick on July 5. We got to the gate in plenty of time to check in and found a very long line. Boarding was not in any order, by row, by children, by old, or any thing else. It was a first come first on scramble. This is where Easyjet really showed its true competence, As people were boarding the ticket takers were using totally different criteria for carryons. The woman on the right was letting everything go on. One bag, two bags, three bags, whatever didn't matter. The woman on the left was more selective. If she liked the way you looked you could take whatever you wanted. Well we were at the bake of the line because the lady on the left kept saying ""you have too much."" My wife asked if she could bring a purse on the plane. Answer...NO!. Question. Where can I keep my pass port? Answer...NO!. We finally got through the lady on the left and were ready to board the tram, (Easyjet doesn't use jetways)  When two guys on the ground crew take my carryon and my sons carryon without explanation. So no earplugs, no book no nothing. The only thing my wife has that they did not take was her passport. Let's review, earlier passengers had two and three bags, we had none.
Then came the flight. Everything is a  charge. No big, don't care, the flight was 2 hours. What was entertaining was the flight attendants. From vigorously Telling a couple that they could not wear hats in the exit aisle to selling cheap jewelry and watches  at over priced rates to the captured audience. And selling train tickets with a true flea market pitch.
To recap this flight, it sucked.
Gotta love capitalism. But buyer beware.
Will probably never use them again. I will pay more to evade the crap that they pull.
Happy travel."|easyjet
514|"Easy Jet is a low cost airline with shady, rip-off policies.  We are flying with our small 4 pound Yorkie on United to Europe and we bought tickets on Easy Jet from Berlin to Amsterdam.   Then we checked and were told NO dogs are allowed (even if you pay) except seeing eye dogs.  Huh!  Ridiculous policy but it's their airline so they can make their own stupid policies.

But they are refusing to give us a refund, citing the fine print that no one reads when booking a flight.   Really awful service and dismissive, condescending customer service.

DO NOT FLY EASY JET!"|easyjet
515|"If I could give easyjet 5 stars for being a hellish airline, I would. I always knew easyjet wasn't the best airlines... every time I took a trip with them in the past, the flight would always be delayed. Still, I didn't really have such a big problem with easyjet... they were definitely better than Ryanair, whose airplanes are like tinfoil caddy shacks in the sky.

However, I was there when London Luton airport had its crazy bomb threat meltdown. Yeah, it's mostly the airport's fault we had this horrible experience (5 hours in the hot sun with security guards screaming at an unorganized mass of people), but easyjet wasn't completely sympathetic about the situation.

I will say that easyjet did one nice thing. They invited people into their lounge so they could use the bathroom. They also let some people have snacks from their cafeteria for free. That was very nice of them. However, they wouldn't let people stay in their air conditioned lounge unless they were some fancy pants flight club member. I saw a lot of handicapped people suffering in the hot sun. Bad, bad easyjet.

The worst thing easyjet did was the HORRIBLE, UNSYMPATHETIC, and SNARKY customer service people received when they were finally able to enter the airport. People missed their other flights, spent lots of money to trek from London to Luton WHICH IS NOT AT ALL NEAR LONDON, and had to delay their travel plans. I understand that I come from a country where the customer is valued while Europe isn't into that at all. Still, I expect a little humanity after a shitteous event like Luton. People were dehydrated, tired, unhappy, depressed. Maybe some of the customer representatives had also endured the hot sun, but you would think they would be understanding of the situation. Most of the customer reps were hostile, refusing to help passengers unless it was only to change their flight at another time. Yeah there was a big queue and it would take hours to make complaints. And easyjet was unprepared, unorganized... Nevertheless, couldn't they have been nicer to people to compensate? One guy was shaking in anger about missing his next flight. The woman didn't even bat an eye when she said, ""Haven't you heard of travel insurance? It's your responsibility, not ours."" While that may be true... can't this lady have just said, I'm sorry for this unfortunate situation? Or tell the guy how he could call customer service and figure something out (like going to Gatwick airport??).

For me, I was mostly angry that no one ever told us where we could pick up our luggage. I waited an extra 3 hours until I finally found 1 NICE PERSON from easyjet to retrieve it (thank you Richard). However, before that even happened, I had another rep from easyjet threaten me that if I didn't magically find my luggage (which was easyjet's job), easyjet would DESTROY my stuff. And then he told me the last buses were leaving at the same. Moreover, I had waited 30 minutes in line to talk to this rep who kept talking to other people and didn't want to answer my questions. After 9 hours at this terrible airport, I cried.

easyjet, you can redeem yourself. Become more organized for emergencies like this, at least for your own customers at Luton Airport. I'm also angry that I had to spend 60 USD for bus fare to come back to my rescheduled flight and that easyjet ""might"" look into my situation to refund me. I get that shit happens and people should have bought travel insurance or this or that... but it's just an extra expense some people can't take.

Have a heart, easyjet. It was a terrible day. Try to give customers a little peace."|easyjet
516|"Less than Easyjet. One star.

I'm a saint. Not in the true definition of the word, but I'm saintly in my actions. I'm better than decent and the antonym of cruel. A man crafted in the character archetype of God? Sure, why not. I'm magnificently attuned and empathetic. When ""bad"" things happen to me, I consider how hard others have it and tough it out. I enjoy any opportunity to embrace a difficulty and keep my feet planted firmly on the ground. In this age of worldwide suffering and turmoil, I realize I'm blessed to have the good fortune with which I'm afforded. I often feel guilty about my sheer luck, because I know not everybody is given this same chance. It makes me want to do something. To tip the scales back in favor of the huddled, wretched masses. Perhaps it's masochism, but I don't believe so. How can I seek out the appropriate level of plight to rationalize my comfortable existence? Easyjet.

Without question, the best way for someone to endure the same travail as the consummately unlucky is to fly Easyjet. No target of genocide in sub-Saharan Africa, no mortar-shelled Middle Easterner and no underfed South Asian laborer would seek a situation as difficult as Easyjet. Flying from Rome to Nice is 294 unconquerable miles for Easyjet. I had heard this airline was run poorly, but I trusted in my strength and saw it as a challenge to embrace. The moment I first encountered the MC Escher-esque twisting maze of baggage queue in Rome, I breathed a heavy sigh of relief. ""Finally,"" I thought. ""An opportunity to stop taking for granted convenience, comfort and minimum levels of respect for paying customers. Thank you, Easyjet"". But alas, sometimes one can receive too much of a good thing.

Maybe it was the two hour long baggage line. Maybe it was that they didn't let us put our bags on the plane and fly out even though the plane wasn't leaving for another 45 minutes. Maybe it was their awful attitude when they accused us of lying that we were in line waiting for two hours. Maybe it was when they they didn't believe us that the flight had been delayed an hour and could easily accomodate two ticketed passengers. Maybe it was that they would not give us a refund due to their mistakes or even offer us a token credit for the next day's flight. Maybe it was that the next day's flight was three hours delayed. Maybe it was all of these things, I don't know. But eventually they broke me. Like the glutton who overeats, I was the masochist tortured too deeply. Easyjet is too rough for even the most ardent and ascetic self-hater. My lip quivered and I fell to the long unwashed Easyjet check-in floor as I cried towards the heavens for safe passage from this purgatory. But I was granted none. Saint or demon, there is no higher power at Easyjet--not even a supervisor to discuss your concerns or provide a solution.

In summary, no man, woman or child should fly Easyjet, Regardless of how much of themselves they wish to sacrifice as tribute to the ill-fated. As a concerned citizen of the world, I can only pray that Easyjet's corporate management and the employees running Rome's airport baggage/ticketing desks are meted brisk and harsh justice at a tribunal chaired by their cast-off customers. Just know that you'd have to kill me and drag my rotting carcass into the cabin to get me to fly this horrendous airline again. I don't care how much or how long the alternatives are. Weep for me and God bless."|easyjet
517|"As of April 30th, Easyjet will only be using online check in!

Easyjet is probably my favourite of the budget airlines to fly with, although I'd really struggle to call it a budget airline most of the time. It seems that no matter how long in advance you buy tickets, these mystical cheap deals seem to never be available.

The painfully orange airline has always been efficient in boarding whenever I've flown with them, and I've never had a problem with them. I love the fact if I print my boarding pass it saves me on waiting in the enormous queues at check in."|easyjet
518|"Nothing like a late flight into Basel-Mulhouse to push my feelings about EvilJet from two starts to one.  (No public transport, so had to take a vulture like taxi.  No other options.)

That's in addition to poorly managed queues that are on the verge of turning violent.  These lines are where your sweet, sweet grandmother turns into elbow swinging zombie warrior bent on post-apocalyptical survival.  

Never.  Again.  Ever."|easyjet
519|"Let me be clear I don't mind the terrible delays and flight and the crew were fine. BUT the customer service is the worst I have ever experienced. The man in the Lutton airport was snapping at us because we asked to speak to the manager and she wouldn't come. When the manager came she just had us call the customer service line. (And the waiting song was Human by Ragabone on repeat and one of the main lines in that song is ""Don't put your blame on me"" (They were trying to inception us!!!)) The first person we talked to was so rude my friend had to hand me the phone because she had to go cry. Then I spoke to the manager who would not admit that there was a problem with the app and that is why we missed our flight. He was extremely rude to me and I started crying too. The only option we had was to buy a new ticket and call another day and hope they pay us back. The whole reason we missed our flight was because we checked in through the app and then the app deleted our boarding passes and said we didn't check in. They kept blaming the app for the issue and said we can't blame Easy jet... for the app with their name on it. By the end of this me and my friends were sitting on the floor of the airport crying and still no one would help us or even comfort us and apologize for the mishap. We have never been treated so badly and they will be hearing from us again. The icing on top of the cake was the sign in front of the desk saying we're here to help but when you would ask them a question they said they could not help. Someone should start a petition to take that down."|easyjet
520|"Love it or hate it, I have to admit I lean on the loving side to Easyjet. It made it possible for me to travel Europe on a shoestring budget, staying in grungy hostels and backpacking. Without it, my student years would have been unbeleivably drab and dreary. Its made family visits possible, as well as last minute getaways with friends. If I had a fairy godmother, it would be this airline.

However, if you ever try to call them to cancel your flight instead of rebooking it online (getting the taxes refunded), well be prepared to hold the phone on the premium number for a long time. It might be better to rebook online, its not worth the hassle talking to their underpaid staff, who I'm sure look like they've entered the workhouse in a Charles Dickens novel. How else could these flights be so cheap?"|easyjet
521|"Cheap tickets from London round trip as long as u don't want to check any bags or eat or drink on the flight (hey it's only one hour thirty minutes!).

Leg room as expected for low cost carrier and Schonefeld Airport is a bit of a pain with long lines and substandard facilities - but it will be replaced soon with the new Brandenburg airport so hopefully the experience will get better."|easyjet
522|Terrible company. You are much better off paying more and fly with a reputable company. Our flight from Paris to Nice was cancelled, as they claimed due to an air traffic controller strike in Marseilles. Funny enough most flights to Nice were not cancelled on that day. We tried to rebook with them, but the wait was more than 40 minutes on the phone at 5 cents a minute and we rebooked and went by train. EasyJet refused to refund our tickets as they claimed it was beyond their control that they had to cancel. However a friend of ours on the same flight who booked directly with them received a refund. We booked over Expedia. Why do some customers receive a refund and some don't? It was exactly the same flight. This makes no sense at all. we also paid for seats and extra luggage. Again: no refund at all. Please avoid the loss of money, time and nerves and book with a company that deserves your trust. EasyJet does not!|easyjet
523|Would strongly advise another airline. I had a booked a flight from Amsterdam back to London, and day of departure, happened to check my email to see that flight was cancelled. Never received a text alert or anything else, just lucky to check my email in the AM otherwise would have shown up to airport with no flight. And no reason given for the cancellation. Then the fun begin. No other flights offered, no help to get back to London. Had to spend a couple hours trying to figure out a way back and ended up taking a 6 hour train ride instead of a 1 hour flight. Wasn't able to make it to my hotel in Oxford, and due to the late cancellation, lost the money I spent on the hotel. Best part was that Easyjet only refunded me €95 out of the €250 I spend on the ticket. Can't figure that one out and am trying to get an answer from them. So I'm now out cost of hotel, cost of plane ticket, cost of train trip, and a whole day lost on my vacation. Googled to see why cancellation and found a few articles about Easyjet that shows they cancel a lot [insider.co.uk/news/easyj…. So, yes they are a cheaper alternative if they actually fly, but most likely you will end up stuck and out of pocket with a great deal of headache and frustration.|easyjet
524|"They market that they have cheap tickets, but 1) it's not that cheap, and 2) u can have only one small luggage in total (including the carry on), so if u pay the extra bag fee for a round trip, it costs you more at the end.

I had to pay 70 euros just for a small handbag, so the ticket was definitely not cheap. Plus the lady was rude in Berlin."|easyjet
525|"Unfortunately, we were not able to take advantage of the flight we purchased as we were told by the Easy Jet Manager at the London airport that our flight was cancelled.
We were travelling as a family of 5 and had already checked in our luggage.
The manager advised that the flight was cancelled and that we should retrieve our luggage from the hold.
He also advised that  if we needed to get to Paris that day, we should purchase other means of transportation.  We did need to arrive in Paris as we had to meet another group and travel from there. He assured us that Easy Jet would reimuburse us for the train expense.
We purchased 5 train tickets and immediately provided proof of purchase to Easy Jet customer service along with receipt proving we had checked our luggage.
The response I have received on many occasions is that the flight was not in fact cancelled and that we would not be reimbursed.
So we were given wrong information by an Easy Jet manager, experienced significant inconvenience and  incurred additional expense.  I have been attempting to resolve this matter since early November 2015 and have explained that we did not simply not show up for the flight or decide to leave the airport.  We were expressly told to leave and retrieve our checked bags.  In all cases I've gotten the same response suggesting that we were in the wrong and that Easy Jet has no responsibility to reimburse us for our cost and their error in communication.
We believe this is unacceptable."|easyjet
526|"I really feel this airline should be called SleazyJet. It was a good price initially for a short hop from Paris to Biarritz. I was travelling with a bicycle and on the website clicked the appropriate icon for sport equipment to pay. The site prompted me on and I chose the weight for my bike in protective bag and my only piece of 'hold baggage' as they call it. I only booked the bicycle this way because the website indicated I had to which turned out not to be the case.

At the airport after some wandering as SleazyJet apparently doesn't warrant signage at CDG paris I found the check in/baggage drop. I was told I had only booked a regular bag and not the required sport equipment. I assured her I clicked the icon and was prompted on. She said it was wrong and I would have to pay the sport equipment amount. I said well fine just charge me the difference and she replied she couldn't but had to charge the full amount. So of course I said then just refund me the other amount on the initial bag I booked. Again the reply was she can't and I would have to cross the hall to the customer service desk and get my refund there. I told her to just do the charge so the bike could get loaded and I would deal with the refund once the bike was on it's way which is what I did.

Unfortunately at the customer service desk I was told they couldn't process a refund there and I would have to contact sleazyjet directly. At the end of my trip with reliable internet again I looked for contact on the Sleazyjet website. Contact info kept directing me to a FAQ page none of which fit and a phone number that didn't work. After much hunting I found an email and requested my refund which seemed quite straight forward. After over a week I got a reply and again it was simply NO fees were non refundable. At no time did any of the 3 or 4 check in people or the 'customer service' person tell me a fee was non refundable. I paid for 2 hold bags and only flew with 1 strictly due to how their own website directed me. In fact I never had to pre book that bag as the website implied so the whole thing seems a scam.

Beyond that the wait in the departure was without air conditioning or ventilation on a very hot day. The line up for boarding was long and slow and then into the gangway again with no AC or venting and more long wait. We sat on the ground quite a while and took off about 30 minutes late. The staff were not interested in the guests, and the seats were quite threadbare and cramped. Makes you wonder about the rest of the aircraft. I really felt if there had been a problem the staff would have come to life to collect extra fees for oxygen masks or life preservers or any other emergency item.

If I absolutely had to I might consider flying them again but I would certainly exhaust all other options first including a much longer train ride."|easyjet

528|"I was on a group tour with a lot of people in Europe and part of our itinerary for the tour was to take a flight from Greece to Italy. Their was about 30 of us and we all could honestly say that our experience with EasyJet was the worst. It all began with the check-in procedure, which was really unorganized. So we were only allowed one carry-on bag which includes a small purse. I thought that was unreasonable since other airlines that fly domestically allow one personal bag like a purse and one carry-on, a total of 2 bags to take into the plane. I came in with a total of 3 bags (a purse, a carry-on bag, and a rolling bag to check-in). I ended up having to check in and pay an extra 30 euros for my carry-on bag since they only allowed 1 bag to take inside the plane, which was my purse. Later on I found out that other people were given the opportunity to take in their purse and their carry-on bag in the plane for free and that it all depended on which person you talked to in order to check in. There was no consistency and it was really unfair! Plus the flight from Greece to Italy was not full at all and there was plenty of cabin space for additional bags. I was planning to put my purse under my chair anyways and my carry-on in the cabin, so it wouldn't take any additional space at all. I believe it was just another way to pocket our money. They didn't even consider that my group and I were all tourists and that they should expect a lot of us to carry extra bags while traveling, for gifts and souvenirs. It's common sense. But I guess airlines like this are just in it for the money and don't value customer service. The check-in specialists were also rude and they honestly had a difficult time explaining their rules and regulations regarding baggage and weren't informative at all.

They're great as a budget airline but not if you're looking for comfortability and peace of mind."|easyjet
529|"First time flying with them. As we were checking in, they took our luggages with an added 35 euros fee. After given our boarding passes and right about boarding time, our luggage which was just designed to stick out the sides, even if it was empty, was told by a rude gentlemen who worked for easy jet, by the name of meesha or ""Brian"" which was written on his name tag. He prompted us that we had to pay 55 euros to check in our bag, wouldn't even listen to what sense we were making. He kept giving us a smirk look and kept asking cash or credit. Horrible service, horrible guy who I wish never ever to see in my life. This man should be fired and never dealt with."|easyjet
530|"We've used Easyjet extensively over the last 5 years, travelling to Nice, Liverpool, Prague and Barcelona. We are regular users of the Gatwick to Barcelona route, maybe 6 times a year.

Overall, our experience has been positive, and I agree with Amethyst about the overall service, and the staff especially.

On-line booking is normally fairly straightforward, although the back-up when things go awry is frustrating - long waits on the phone and all that (at your expense). The other thing the booking system can't do is do multiple bookings to the same destination unless everyone is on the same flight: to get different times, you need to make separate bookings and endure paying whichever card fee is appropriate to your card.

But there's no denying that their prices are normally competitive - the secret really is to book early, as last minute deals no longer seem to crop up much. I reckon it is worth booking at least 8 weeks in advance. I must confess we don't go for the extras: we normally try to get away with just hand luggage (years of travelling to the Far East means I can pack with brutal efficiency) and I print the boarding pass beforehand (so you get in boarding group 'A' anyway), and so on.

One tip is not to get carried away looking for the absolute cheapest flight when flying from London: it's amazing how many people forget to add items such as rail and tube fares into the overall cost - which bumps up the cost of getting to Luton or Stansted, to say nothing of the extra time. (We tend to stick to Gatwick).

The main downers normally are (a) flight delays from Gatwick in high summer, and (b) sometimes the boarding process is not as rigorous as it should be. To be fair, punctuality has been great so far this year, with most flights departing early: I hope it is not a case of 'famous last words'! On the upside, the cabin prices for drinks and snacks aren't too bad - a damn sight cheaper than the same products bought from trolleys on trains! (Although I normally buy before I get on).

I've used their hotel booking service once - their partner is Hotelopia, and we got a really good deal in Prague (though I checked out the hotel itself extensively both on Qype and other commentary sites to ensure we were OK!).

We've had two experiences when things have gone wrong. The first time, one of my suitcases got seriously, seriously mangled (it fell under the baggage trolley), bursting a bottle of shampoo and crushing completely a hair and beard trimmer. Unfortunately, we didn't realise just how bad it was until we got home, which then required a certain amount of paperwork (it is easier if you register the damage at the airport). Despite their various exclusion clauses, after a little to-ing and fro-ing, they paid me the value of a new suitcase, hair clipper and the laundry bill to get the shampoo off a leather jacket. So, 9/10 for that.

The other time, we were stuck in Gatwick at Christmas 2006 because of fog. What could have been a total nightmare - and it wasn't a great experience - was at least handled decently: we were offered another flight the next day from Luton which worked fine, and we got food and drink vouchers, which paid for some real ale and comfort food in Gatwick's Wetherspoon's, which helped to calm frayed nerves. So, 7/10 for that experience, which is about as good as it could have been.

We've also had to change flight bookings due to illness at short notice - you can rebook up to two hours before departure at a penalty of £15 per person, per flight, plus any difference in the fare. This has worked fine for us, and beats the 'no-change' restrictions on some other cheap flights.

Phew. That's a long enough review. We're off to Barcelona in a few weeks, so I hope I don't have to eat any of my words!!"|easyjet
531|"Granted I only took 1 flight on EasyJet (London-Barcelona), but it was surprisingly good.

The plane was newish and well serviced. I was expecting late boarding and take off, surly service, etc. but it wasn't anything like that. It was just like any other airline.

Regarding the no assigned seats and priority boarding for a fee; we chose free boarding going to Spain and we actually upgraded to the priority boarding on the way back.

The regular boarding is a bit disorganized and a hassle. It's like hectic boarding for a bus. We managed to get a good seats since we're a couple, but for a solo traveler, you can DEFINITELY wind up in a middle seat and that sucks.

As for paying for priority boarding, I think it's a decent value especially since you fly for a really cheap price. It does make a difference in getting a good seat, though, if a lot of people opt for it, it sorta cancels out the benefit."|easyjet
532|"I flew with Easy Jet to Barcelona (El Pratt) and also to Italy.  I could not believe how cheap and it was and how decent it was!

This was a budget airline. I couldn't have noticed less. By the time, I sat down read a bit of foreign language books and nattered on and on and tortured the girlfriend I was there.

Easy Jet is great! You don't get a meal in flight but when you are flying so close who cares. I had decent leg room but I'm petite (5'3). I did feel a bit smashed with another airline so I guess Easy Jet was good.

Easy Jet has the best prices. I'll be flying with them again soon."|easyjet
533|I have some good news to report! After talking to their customer service and sorting all the facts out, Easy Jet acknowledged the mistake was on their part and refunded me the cost if the entire flight to and from Barcelona....so there was at least a happy ending to go with the tough start if my trip!|easyjet
534|"By far the worst traveling experience I've ever had. I booked my flight traveling to Barcelona and was ""suppose"" to catch a 7:30am flight but when I tried checking in online the night before the iPhone app was conveniently for them not operating because they oversold the flight so that's why I kept getting the error code and when I attempted to do it online the website told me I could not check in. I arrived at the ticket counter before the last check in time and they would not issue me a ticket. I had to go to the longest line ever in customer service where I was issued a flight 12 hours later!!!! I was not given any type of credit or incentive even though it was their fault for overbooking! I lost a day of travel and was left behind from the rest of my party! The only thing that saved me was that I actually purchased travel insurance so I didn't have to pay the 65 pound rebooking fee!  Worst experience ever! Do yourself a favor and spring for a little more cash on your travel And fly with a company that will appreciate your business!"|easyjet
535|"I purchased 4 tickets (with missed flight insurance) on easyJet. Our flight into Gatwick was late and we missed our easyjet connection. We were 30 minutes prior to the flight leaving, but the gate was closed. We went to easyJet customer service and had to pay 320Pounds for a ""rescue fee"" which they said would be reimbursed as we had flight insurance. We paid the fee. I got home and requested to be reimbursed. In order to qualify, you had to be fit to fly (check), be at the airport no more than 4 hours late (check) and report to customer service (check). Customer service issued us the new boarding passes.
now easyJet customer service has emailed a one sentence reply to me. Because their employee made no notes in the computer system, my claim is denied. Although I am not responsible for the actions of their employees, and notes on the computer are not terms or conditions of the agreement, I have now been denied my claim.
This company and their insurance is a scam. This is utter fraud to sell a service, have your customer fulfill their obligations, and then deny payment under the conditions of the agreement.
I would be careful with this company. It feels they operate in a fashion to get your money, rip you off, and then hope you go away."|easyjet
536|"As far as budget airlines go, I'm quite a fan of EasyJet and would certainly chose to fly with them over other cheaper airlines such as Ryan Air and Monarch.

You basically get what you pay for. Cheap flights = reduced leg room and chaotic boarding. But hey, they usually tend to be short flights and I'm quite often traveling on my own, so I am happy to let the hoards fight it out for the 'best' seats, I'll have what ever is left.

I don't tend to purchase food or drink on board as the price is usually extortionate and the quality poor. It's much easier to grab something at the airport and take it on with you.

Luggage costs extra but this is commonplace now and the limits are certainly more generous than others I could mention.

To top it all, I have come across some great stewards on EasyJet flights. The highlight on my latest trip back from France was the extremely camp air host who kept us entertained with his banter and X-Factor auditions!"|easyjet
537|"Possibly the worst airline I ever used. The plane and service on it is okay but the customer service center is something out of this world. I was overcharged for a flight and even with the print out of the final confirmation page they refused to refund the difference of the overcharge. They admitted their mistake but ""because they are a non refundable airline they are not going to issue a refund for my flight"". !?!?!? At the end I let my credit card company deal with this...
Besides you can find much better and cheaper price from other companies in Europe. At the end with their extra charges (not counting the overcharge) I paid more than other air companies on the actual flight line."|easyjet
538|"After many years of planning, saving money and working with my doctors I, as an autoimmune patient braved the family trip we had all dreamed of to London, Paris & Rome. Doctor's notes written to be furnished at the airport, if needed. International Medical Bracelet with information available immediately by website not to mention the international sign for medical patient charm included. All medications and supplements in their large, original and inconvenient space consuming containers as asked by all airline carriers. More doctors' notes in my carry-on so there could be no mistaking their ingredients necessary to my vital well-being. My drops and ointments along with my doctors for a my chronic dry eye and infection condition which had to be easily accessible at all times and with me at all times kept in a tiny, side purse about one inch in thickness and 7 by 5 in measurement and weighing less than a pound. A little life important bag that that on all my previous flights with other airlines were cleared to sit next to me (I have a small frame, luckily) right at my side, under my seatbelt, no problem.
But that all changed when I handed a very solemn, very cold hearted Easyjet passenger agent my ticket and she insisted the pouch purse go into my carry on as we were only allowed one. I attempted to explain to her my situation including the fact that the carry on was so stuffed with all my other medical needs, nothing else, even the small pouch purse would fit into it and I had to have it with me, not above, and not under the seat for my condition. She dismissed me rudely, and insisted it go inside the carry on, without so much of an ounce of trying to understand me. I showed her my medical bracelet and my doctor's note, but she still shook her head no without any kindness in her face. She was rude, unprofessional, heartless and a downright mean control freak. My stepmother had to scramble to put my tiny eye drop purse into her bag, which barely fit, causing havoc in line, so that we could proceed to board. I then had to sit there until after takeoff, my eyes hurting worse and worse (I am in danger of blindness in dry conditions like airplanes) until takeoff and the seatbelt sign went off before my stepmother could hand me my tiny little eye drop bag. It did not matter that I put drops and ointment on right before getting in line to board, I need this every few minutes in extreme dry conditions to avoid flare up and further infection. Once I had it back, it stayed by my side, just as all other flights and airlines, until we landed, the flight attendants not batting an eye. Although the flight was smooth, the airplane clean, the flight timely, etc. the flight attendants had a complete cold, dismissive manner towards the passengers and impatient with those who did not understand that even a cup of coffee cost money because there was no English annouement about it following French and Italian. The recordings on the plane were generic and flying Easyjet was much like being inside a giant flying computer with no heart.

People with medical conditions deserve far more respect than this. Paying passengers deserve far more respect than this as they are your customers. I was not asking to have a huge purse sit on my lap. And I had all the doctors' notes and bracelet to prove this was necessary and it was recognized by everyone in every airport and on every airline but Easyjet. I did MY part by being prepared. For those of you who have voted this ""funny"" I do not see what is so funny about this. Try having a chronic condition and see how you would like be treated like this. I will never fly this stupid, stuck up airline again and I will be sure to warn others as well."|easyjet
539|Socially awkward Italian flight attendants on the London to Naples flight.  They only greet or acknowledge you when you board and depart the plane if you're white.  I made careful observations with multiple people.  I guess they don't like feeling like servants to non-white people.  People always want to have a high status without working for it.|easyjet
540|"Man, do I have a love-hate relationship with this company.........

Every time I fly Easyjet, I swear it will be the last time.  Then, when I compare prices, I buy my tickets again.

This is a good service to offer people.  I understand it is a no-frills airline, and you will not get the same level of service that I have experienced in Executive Class on Air Canada.  I get it.  Seriously.

However, we have a discount airline in Canada as well (WestJet), and they took the frills away, yet still offer a dynamite service within the boundaries of no frills.

Easyjet.... I hope you are reading this.

What works with EasyJet:
1.  The pricepoint. If you have the ability to travel, you typically want to spend your cash on the vacation - not the flight.  EasyJet does offer an affordable option.  I do tip my hat to that, and I also get roped in every time by the significant price difference over their competitors.

2.  I have never had a flight cancel, I have never been on a late flight, and I have also never had my luggage lost.  They do know what they are doing in that respect.

3.  I like that you have to pay for your luggage.  I like having the choice whether to pay for luggage, or pack smarter to enjoy that savings.  Thank you EasyJet for the choice.

What makes me crazy:
1.  I cannot see any reason on God's green earth why they don't have assigned seating.  The rush seating makes people lunatics.  The lineups and at times, the plane ride can be stressful for that one reason.  WestJet in Canada has assigned seating - it gives a level of control over the boarding process, and everyone knows where they are and that they have a seat.  The last 2 out of 4 flights, there were passengers that did something crazy (one left his ipad somewhere, and the other one -- I can't remember), but it has the crew panicking to get the issue resolved to get the flight out on time.  I know there are scatterbrained people everywhere (sometimes I am one of them!) but those are the types of things that happen when you put a fire under a few hundred people's butts and everyone is rushing.  
2.  Paying for assigned seating:  I understand their concept of paying for an assigned seat.  It is a revenue opportunity.  However, from what I have seen, on a discount airline like EasyJet, there are VERY few people who pay for this service.  Lineup 1 is a very short line.  I'd rather see them tack $20 onto each luggage bag and ASSIGN seats.  Take away the craziness!

EasyJet, thank you for your affordable, reliable service.  I can't fault  you for that.  But man, I tell you.... if you would have assigned seating for everyone, that would rock my world."|easyjet
541|Worst airline ever.  Since they have all the power over you, the gate agents extort money out of you.|easyjet
542|"That's right EJ, you've just earned yourself another star.

It really is just easy flying with you. My recent trip to Marrakesh was seamless - the flights, though both completely full, were still quite comfortable, they left on time, landed early, the staff on both legs were friendly and helpful and there were no ash clouds of doom to speak of so it was completely smooth sailing. Or flying. Or whatever.  

Maybe you won't be my go-to crisis airline, but for the cheap short hops you truly are the best low cost airline. #Nachofact: I should probably stay on the ground during international no-fly crises anyhow. Noted.

Now if we could just sort out that whole Gatwick thing..."|easyjet
543|"""Be outside at 5:30am, we'll have a shuttle pick you up and bring you back to the airport for your 8am flight.""

Sounds great in theory, right? After spending the entire day (10am - 8:45pm) in the airport the day before only to have our flight canceled, I was quite impressed how quickly and efficiently EasyJet found a hotel for all of the passengers and made sure we all had meals and transportation.

Except then you didn't show up. We waited... and waited... and at about 6:45am the hotel lobby received a call: ""flight is delayed until.... ""

Yeah, we got that.

In the end though, even after being stood up outside in the wee hours of the morning, I am rather impressed with how EasyJet handled the situation. Our flight ended up leaving at 6:30pm the next evening evening, and through the network of passengers who continued to call EasyJet and then relay the information via phone and text to all of our new-found stranded friends, we all made it back safe and sound, with full bellies.

Putting up every passenger in a hotel and covering every meal and taxi ride (regardless of travel insurance) definitely earned you yours stars this time around. It was the passengers and crew who I grew to know and love over the ordeal that really sealed the deal."|easyjet
544|"Ok EasyJet, so I know this whole death cloud ash volcano / Lost smoke monster publicity stunt isn't your fault. But it's been around for a while now... the least you could do is not act like this is the very first you've heard of such a thing!

When my 1st flight was cancelled, you acted as if the word Eyjafjallajokull was strange. Er... you know what I mean. It's practically a part of my daily vocabulary at this point! (It is also what I reckon Iclandic people say when someone sneezes, but that is beside the point.)

So you re-scheduled me. Cool. But then my 2nd flight was delayed. And delayed again. And again. And again. A flight that was meant to leave early in the morning has now stranded me at the airport. It's 7pm and I'm hungry! I'm sorry, but a EUR 4.50 voucher doesn't go far when a bottle of water costs EUR 2.75. Seriously? ... Seriously.  

After a charade of getting on a plane, only to have to turn around, hear that the flight was officially canceled, get back off, and be hassled by some seriously confused customs officers who couldn't comprehend the fact that I had a departure stamp from an hour ago (although all of the EU passport carries were fine,) I waited in your line foooooooever to figure out what the hell was going on. I'm hungry. I'm tired. I'm pretty frustrated that I didn't get to enjoy the sunshine, nor was I able to get any work done... so things are looking pretty 1-star at this point. But then in the most crucial of moments, you redeemed yourself.

-You fed me
-You put me up in a hotel
-You covered the taxi ride
-You scheduled a bus in the morning
-You had the hotel open their breakfast service early for me (Ok, and a plane full of others...)

I know the volcano isn't your fault. And while things were looking dire in the middle there, you really pulled things out. I'll just echo what everyone else says: you're paying pennies for a flight. It your own fault if you don't know what you're getting into!

...Don't make me update you tomorrow, EasyJet! Continue to behave yourself, now!"|easyjet

546|"Amsterdam is a hub of KLM airlines. After the whole Europe trip, I was relaxed thinking my returning flight is from Amsterdam and by KLM airlines.  It was flight KLM 0643 from Amsterdam to JFK. We reached on time and check-in, Security went smooth. My wife's name came in random passenger check ( US drama of course), but again, we boarded first due to this. Boarding did not take much time. The flight was super comfortable. The air hostess was there to help.

Plenty of leg space in the economy section. Better than USA airlines.  This time the food was good, I got chicken curry with rice. The dessert was really good. Plenty of options in Movies (all genres- all major languages), games, music, etc.

I would definitely think of KLM whenever go to Europe."|klm-royal-dutch-airlines

548|I love this airlines. I am not sure why it does not have a higher rating. I can say that the flight attendants were spectacular and the food was very delicious for airline food. I didn't care for the Heineken beer or the red wine they served, but the white wine was very good from South Africa. It is cool to be able to get out of your seat and grab a treat at the back of the plane when you feel like it. They had granola bars, dark and milk chocolate and these types of pretzels with a really nice seasoning on it. I flew economy and the seats were a little small, but not so bad .  I think the service really made my trip from the USA to Amsterdam and then to France. This airlines beats any US carrier by far. I even booked my next trip on KLM because of the service and the rewards they offer members.|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
549|"I have flown KLM four times in the last month, once Amsterdam/Porto/Amsterdam, and once Amsterdam/Helsinki/Amsterdam. Between these four times transiting the airport, I've had very similar experiences and none of them good.

To and from Porto, we were on a bus to a hard stand. I hate hard stands. Why do we have to take a super-crowded bus to a plane when AMS is allegedly one of the best airports in Europe? This is nonsense!

The boarding process sucks, but part of that is because the space for queueing is too narrow for economy and premium passengers to have separate spaces. And then the gate agents don't seem to enforce it. Stupid.

Planes were on time, which is about the only good thing that I can say about it.

I fly Delta and I fly to and from Europe. So I will be continuing to spend time on KLM flights and I will grit my teeth and bear it because there really isn't much choice. CDG and Air France are no better.

550|"Flying from Amsterdam to Milan was pretty painless. Lots of seats at the gate, though the two staff just stood there while everyone scanned their boarding pass on the automated gates. Lots of times the automated gates didn't scan properly and the line moved slowly. They should also have the staff scan manually to speed up the process of boarding!

The plane was a small 737-700. It was old just like the plane I had from Toronto. The flight attendants were friendly. The cheese and ham sandwich provided for breakfast was cold and plain--poor choice folks!"|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
551|"Good airline for intl economy.

Friendly service, planes are not old, seats arent overly scrunched together. Better than the mainline US airlines for international.

Always a plus to transfer at Amsterdam, a lovely airport with kids play areas, music, library, museum, and lots of shops."|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
552|I left two books on the flight. I contacted lost and found to retrieve my books back. Their response was nope we don't have it and don't leave books on the airplane because it indicates you don't want them. What the hell....Are you serious, so I would advise customers to remember to take their belonging because you won't get those items back. I could only imagine if it was something serious left behind. So, therefore, they basically don't properly clean the plane and return items back to the lost and found|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
553|"I was flying from Amsterdam to LA with my Dutchman and it was my first time flying with KLM. He strongly suggested us flying with KLM after his first time flying experience with Delta to Atlanta. I have always flown with Delta, so this time I was willing to try a new airline, despite my loyalty to Delta. I was hoping to prove my boyfriend wrong that Delta was far more superior than KLM.

However I hate to say this but KLM ranked higher when it came to organization, professionalism and quality. The service for KLM was professional and staff friendly. I look forward to booking many more flights with KLM. Keep up the good work! In addition I  would like note to travelers the best place to purchase souvenirs is at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. I always wait to pick up my souvenirs for family and friends at the Amsterdam airport. As far as quality and prices, it's so much better."|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
554|Had connecting flights via Delta partnership from Amsterdam to Madrid and I'm not impressed. The Boeing 737's were very dated, no in-flight entertainment (maybe for longer flights?), and seats in the main cabin were cramped. We had no issues connecting and with our carry on luggage the first trip, rather the return. The Madrid airport gate agents (not employed by KLM?) went out of their way to single out at least dozen plus passengers to make them check in their bags (apparently my approved 21 inch carry on didn't fit their criteria). The flight was not even full on a early weekday and there was a lot of over overhead luggage space remaining...ain't nobody got time to waste at baggage claim..they really to be trained better. Warm breakfast sandwiches might be some consolation, if you're into processed egg and cardboard bread.|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
555|Just a note to say that there was never any follow-up from the airline, but since their yelp! page is unclaimed, that suggests they really don't want to be bothered with consumer-customers, or that they  don't want to be bothered with yelp! and yelpers.|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
556|"KLM completely dropped the ball on failing to provide for my mobility needs on leaving Amsterdam Schiphol Airport and for my arrival at Düsseldorf Airport in Germany!  Furthermore, they didn't get my luggage to Düsseldorf along _with_ me.  All combined, the lack of proper attention to me, my individual needs (as well-explained and documented with their partner airline, Delta) and management of my luggage, I am very disappointed with Koninklijke Luchtvaart Mastschappij!

Note to KLM - if your employees had their names on badges they wore, they might be more concerned about being good to customers, for we'd be able to complain about them by name, rather than ""that junior attendant in the blue uniform.""  First initial and last name should be adequate.

When I arrived at my gate in Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, I stood a full SEVEN MINUTES before the blue-uniformed junior attendants deigned to acknowledge my presence at their podium.  Two staff were too busy talking to each other, and the other was staring at a computer monitor, but not typing anything.  I needed to ensure they would enable me to board at the right time, and that they would arrange for some small assistance once I arrived in Düsseldorf.  I was on a ""Cityhopper"" plane, which requires a person to walk up a steep staircase to ascend the plane, then back down to get away from it. I also had to walk down stairs from the check-in gate to the plane going to Düsseldorf, before climbing up into it.   I was promised some assistance, and did not get it.  Surely, there are elevators that could get a person down to the level of the tarmac.  When I got to the luggage carousel at Düsseldorf, I waited more than 20 minutes for all of the luggage to come through, and discover that mine was not there.  I then had to walk the full length of this very long airport, to the other end, where lost and found offices are located.  The airline was supposed to supply/provide a wheelchair.  I managed to file claim paperwork for two lost checked bags, and then begin to look for my contact in the airport, which really does not have adequate seating available.  It was certainly annoying, too, to see so many people pushing empty folded-up wheelchairs about in the airport, when nobody came to give me a ride in one of them.  Suffice to say, it was a very trying and uncomfortable experience, the entirety of which did not end until a full twelve hours later when my bags were finally delivered to the home where I am staying.  Also, we were not called and told about the bags being found, it was we who initiated contact with a long-distance call to Frankfurt, and then us following up with another number.  I certainly did NOT intend to have to stay awake until 11:15 at night to answer the door for a delivery service.  I will be asking Delta for some credit on a future flight, as compensation for the nightmare of the last part of my travel."|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
557|"KLM is refusing to refund me one-way airfare for travel that was canceled this spring due to the coronavirus pandemic. My flight was canceled as was all travel reservations. I submitted a request for a refund and have now called several times only to receive contradictory statements. I was told I could only receive a voucher which would be of absolutely zero value to me since travel is required to be completed by December, 2020. Then I was told that I would receive a refund, but as the weeks passed without a refund being issued, I again called KLM. Only to be told once again that I will  only be issued a voucher and will not receive a refund.

The agent's excuses were nothing short of ludicrous. I booked my travel directly with KLM on their website. She told me that because my travel was routed BY KLM to their European site, I am only eligible for a voucher

This is completely underhanded and OUTRAGEOUS. The other carrier who I booked the majority of my air travel with for this trip already refunded me 100% of my fare.

Moral of the story: DO NOT FLY KLM. For as long as I live, I will NEVER book travel with them.

They are CROOKS!!"|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
558|"I really enjoyed my flights. The service was excellent. The messaging system and updates I received directly via messenger was very convenient. By far my favorite of all the airlines I have traveled with. I will find it hard to fly with a different airline in the future. And the Dreamliner plane was perfect for me since I am tall.

An overall great experience for someone that typically does not enjoy flying."|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
559|Recently flew from Amsterdam to Atlanta ( as well as Budapest to Amsterdam).  I am an avid traveler. kLM flight attendants need to learn some lessons from Delta!  We were all asked to stand up to close our own bins... there were no call buttons. I am pretty sure the flight attendant did everything in her power to hit me every single time she walked by. We traveled with two people that needed assistance and they were non helpful. The entire 9 hour trip. No air vents on the plane; it was like a sweat box on the plane. Just a horrible experience all the way around. We had a total of three legs with KLM; not a one time instance. Very unfortunate... Delta did listen to our concerns however. Just want others to understand... this airline IS NOT Delta even though you may book through Delta|klm-royal-dutch-airlines

THE SCENE

It was my first time crossing the pond and stepping onto European soil. I was so stoked just to be here that it would have taken a severe force of nature to wipe the smile and sense of adventure off my face! We arrived in Amsterdam via Delta Airlines. Spent about 3 hours between flights roaming the airport and finally made it to our KLM gate for a flight bound to Kenya Africa (see my 410 bridge review for the Kenya experience).

I honestly almost passed-out from excitement as I looked out the airport window to see a DOUBLE DECKER plane just waiting to be boarded. Lifetime bucket list CHECK MARK!!! I could barely wait to get on board! I was losing it in line with excitement, talking to anyone within arms reach because I was just so thrilled that I finally get a chance to fly in one of these super-sized planes. I thought to myself a plane this size is going to take forever to board, but thoughtfully they had two lines with two separate entry doors onto the plane. One was located in its traditional spot near the front of the plane while the other was near the middle of the plane. Since we were all the way to the rear, we entered in the middle.
...

THE EXPERIENCE

The flight attendant were so dang friendly I kinda sorta but not really got the vibe that one of them was flirting. She took especially good care of me the entire flight and even stopped  several times just to chat. The flight to Kenya was nearly 9 hours and in that time we talked probably 30 minutes when you add up her random visits. I tell you, for a happily married guy of 18 years, having an attractive 30 something Dutch stewardess show you such great attention was a thrill in itself!  

I was given the option to have my own row of seats near the rear window since the flight was not full and I took it! This was the most comfortable experience of each of our four flights from Atlanta to Kenya. It was a long flight and I didn't sleep even once, but I was grateful for the HUGE selection of free movies offered and really got a chance to catch up on several films. Even got the chance to watch some unique films such as one about a rich Italian father who decided to teach his three spoil adult children a lesson in humility and values. Or another about a man who fights to save his wife's life while comatose in the hospital. At the same time a young female fights for her husbands life after a severe car accident. In total I watch 4 movies during my flight which made time pass easily.

KLM gives you a hot eucalyptus scented towel before every meal. We had lunch and dinner during our flight with a decent sized snack in between. Water was readily available and drinks came around probably every 2 hours or so. The food was far better than I expected since I can only think of one other time I had an actual meal on a plan instead of peanuts and cookies. My first meal was some sort of chicken rice dish w/dried raisins, a roll, a yellow slaw-like dish and a fluffy tiramisu-ish dessert. The second meal was a flatbread pizza with the same dessert and Caprese Salad. They also included light snacks with each meal, but sadly I can't remember what they were.

The flight was as smooth as warm butter spreading on a hot roll. I cannot comment on the price since it was part of my mission trip package, but I'd say it was well worth it!
....

THE VERDICT

I would not hesitate to fly on this aircraft again. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience! I exited feeling valued and special. No lost luggage, awesome & attentive service, great movie/TV/games selection and decent hot meals. I'm now definitely a KLM fan.

561|I've flown KLM both business and coach - they have high standards. The lounge areas are a great perk although super crowded. Flew business with a 11 month old, extremely accommodating and would wait for me to be ready to give me any service which was so nice and made it feel patient and kind.|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
562|"KLM is usually very expensive to fly to/from the USA, so I haven't had much opportunity to fly with KLM until today. I flew an inter-Europe flight between Bergen and Amsterdam, which, to my surprise was very good. All KLM inter-Europe flights serve a snack (or snack if the flight is longer). My flight was in the morning, so I got a breakfast ""cake"", similar to a pound cake, which was pretty tasty. They also serve alcohol on inter-Europe flights free of charge in economy class. To note, alcohol is also served in the morning -- I got a white wine to accompany my breakfast cake.

The flight attendants were also very friendly, sweet, and smiling, and very accommodating to all passenger needs. For example, there was a lady who was traveling with her baby - the lady needed to use the restroom, and the flight attendant helped watch the baby while the lady used lavatory. I haven't seen this caliber of service with any other airlines until now, so as you can imagine I was pretty impressed!

My flight was only 1 hour 20 minutes in length (it was on time!), although I wished it were longer with the good service we received on board. I hope that I'll be able to travel with KLM again soon. If plane tickets get cheaper, I'd definitely be flying much sooner than later. Tot ziens!"|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
563|Had two pretty good experiences flying with klm. This particular plane was super high tech. They had window sensors that tinted the windows instead of actual shutters. The restroom was all automated too. Food was decent for airplane food. Stewards would have been a little friendlier but they warmed up during the flight. All in all a positive experience.|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
564|KLM is refusing to answer email, phone calls, and all the other social media. I been trying to cancel my flight do the coronavirus ban and they won't do anything or answer. I think in this times is when airlines show their real costumer service skills to try to solve and come to a solution as fast is possible as for today 03/15/2020 it's been 2 weeks since I keep trying to contact them and no answer.|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
565|Though there was one very annoying schoolmarmish (Alan's term) woman at the boarding area and the preboarding seemed disorganized, it went quite smoothly and once we were on the plane the staff was predictably friendly, accessible and professional.  After three weeks of cruise-fueled eating and drinking, on this flight I kept it very simple:  mixed nuts and water were all I wanted and while I was offered more, my refusal was accepted w/ grace.  The flight was uneventful and we landed at SLC on our way to SFO.|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
566|"Airline food is usually meh at best...even in business class on KLM Airlines enroute from Frankfort, Germany to KLM's hub in Amsterdam.

The Chicken Salad box dinner that I had on this flight lived up to that
lackluster billing.

However, tonight I got surprised (in a good way) with the Licorice Lemon Mouse Desert...a flavor I've never seen!  The licorice came through loud and flavorful and was surprisingly tasty!  I'm definitely a fan."|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
567|Beware KLM and Air France baggage fees.  If they code share and you buy a checked bag thorough them that fee may not cover the entire distance of your trip, only part of the trip.  We are being charged a 60 Euro baggage fee per SEGEMENT by them for a return trip to the USA instead of the 60 euro they charged for a bag to Europe as one of the segments is not operated by them.  We would have picked a different airline as it would have been less expensive overall had they had full disclosure of their actual fees.|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
568|"On May 1, 2019, my wife and I were booked on KLM Flight 609 from Amsterdam's Schipol Airport to Salt Lake City, UT.  Flight 609 was scheduled to depart from Gate F3 at 5:00 p.m. (1700 hrs) local time.  

Literally two minutes before boarding was to commence, a nearby passenger noticed that the gate's monitor now showed  Gate F3 was for a KLM flight headed to China.  Confusion erupted and even the gate agents did not know what was going on.  After several more minutes one of the gate agents announced that there was a gate change; our Flight 609 was now departing from Gate E24.

When we reached Gate E24 the agents there told us there would be a 1 hour 30 minutes delay in departure since it was necessary to switch passenger's luggage bags between planes.  That was our first indication that this was not a mere gate change.  I waited in line to speak with a gate agent and was assured that neither I nor any other passengers needed a new boarding pass because it was the same equipment and seat configuration and flight number.  While we waited I noticed several Asian gentlemen approached the gate agent with bewildered looks on their faces.  They were assured their flight was still departing but now it was leaving from Gate F3, our original gate for KLM Flight 609.

An hour later the gate agent suddenly announced that our flight had been cancelled due to a ""technical issue.""  Passengers were instructed to proceed to Transfer Desk 6.   When we arrived there we found eight self-serve computer kiosks.  No one knew how to operate them and there was no KLM representative to aid us.  Almost immediately 2-4 of the machines froze up.  A KLM agent finally made an appearance.  He made it clear that there were no more flights leaving Schipol for the United States that night and we'd have to make arrangements to depart the following day, May 2d.  He did say that delayed passengers would be provided with a hotel room and a meal at KLM's expense.  

Our designated hotel was an Ibis Budget.  I had no idea what Ibis meant but soon learned that it loosely translates to ""prison cell.""  Our room was barely 175 square feet, with no closet, no drawers for clothing, a double bed, a bathroom with a shower only, 1 roll of toilet paper, no facial tissues, no wash clothes, and no hand towels.  When we  inquired at the registration desk about the missing items we were advised that Ibis is a 3-star hotel and thus these basic amenities were not provided and we should have brought our own.  

We did make it out the next day and home 24 hours late.  It was obvious KLM gave out plane to the China bound flight after a technical issue was found with it and left the USA passengers stranded."|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
569|"Great food, amazing service, comfy & spacious, I love the friendly flight crews, and my experiences with KLM are always wonderful.

I wish more US owned airlines appreciated and offered their customers all the perks foreign airlines do. The difference in customer service always astonishes me.

The plane is comfy and every seat has plenty of leg room. Yeah, I'm talking from economy to business class.

My #1 favorite thing about this airline is their customer service. They make you feel appreciated and the flights crews are always so warm and welcoming. Also, this airline pays attention to detail, as does the staff.

Pick a destination, buy a ticket, and GO!!! Worth it!"|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
570|Third time from Schiphol to Aberdeen on a Thursday evening, third time a long delay. For the second time the reason is waiting for flight attendants coming in late with another flight. No way to treat customers.|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
571|"A bit of a rant, but since the KLM staff seem unable to assist in fixing their own error I'm relegated to this forum to voice my displeasure. My girlfriend's outbound KLM flight out of LAX was cancelled a month ago and she was rerouted to another flight a day later. I flew to meet her towards the end of her trip with a common flight booked for us to return together from Tanzania to LAX (two ~10 hour flight legs). She was unable to check in when we tried to check in via the KLM website, which was a concern. Upon arrival she was placed back on the flight, thankfully, but not in the adjacent seat as she had previously arranged. She actually linked our return tickets, to ensure we sat together. When she requested that we be seated together, the staff at Kilimanjaro airport stated that there was nothing they could do.

Upon arrival in Amsterdam we hoped to have better luck in arranging adjacent seats for the second leg of the journey, but the KLM counter at Amsterdam stated it was not possible to be seated adjacent to one another once again. They offered no explanation as to why her original return flight reservation had been deleted and made no offer to compensate us for the inconvenience. The service on the flight and the staff on the plane were great, but the ground staff let us down."|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
572|KLM is one of my favorite airlines. I don't like long flights but KLM was great by making it a nice experience. Honestly don't eat airplane food but I did eat some of their food they served they gave ice cream! It was really good they give wipes and snacks often and their meals compared to other airplanes is a lot better and edible. Their staff is very friendly and nice. They answered all our questions in regards to food allergies and gave us extra water. The plane ride with them was smooth with no problems. Best of all they give plenty of leg room! Compared to Lufthansa and Air France I think that KLM gives the best option. Overall I look forward with flying with them again.|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
573|This airline sucks they have really messed up our trip they lost our luggage in Berlin on 8/24/2018 we flew from New York to Berlin then to Amsterdam we are here for a 60th birthday Celebration but we have no clothes. Then they informed us that they were going to bring our Luggage on Saturday 8/25/2018 still no luggage then we get call at 730pm saying that they tried to deliver but we weren't here that's bullshit cause why didn't they leave it with hotel or call and say we are here we were right next door from hotel the customer service sucks and I will never fly this airline again never never never|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
574|Really poor customer service!!!!  I had a direct flight from Boston to Amsterdam. We checked 3 bags and only 2 arrived.  We were instructed to file a report at the airport, which we did.  It has been 3 DAYS and still no bag.  Not only do we not have the bag, they can't seem to find it!  What are the barcodes for that they put on the luggage tag????  One direct flight...how difficult is it to locate that bag??  The bottom line is KLM Royal Dutch Airlines just doesn't care.  In the interim, we went to purchase clothing and many of the sales people said that this is common with KLM!  NEVER EVER FLYING KLM DUTCH AIRLINES AGAIN!!!  Way to ruin a vacation!|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
575|No words!!! Absolutely the worst customer service ever encountered with an airline. They have no ability or desire to communicate with their passengers. I don't understand how Delta can be partners with this operation.|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
576|Good, friendly customer service. We were having a bad travel day, with our original flight being cancelled (on a different airline). KLM found a solution for us that, although it wasn't great because it meant we had to fly to PHL before BOS, it did get us home quickest. They also gave us a voucher to use towards food while we waited in the airport.|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
577|"I really liked KLM! For a first time traveller with this airline I wasn't sure what to expect. We flew from Glasgow to Tokyo Narita via Amsterdam and all four flights were totally fine, I was very impressed.

On the shorter flights you just get a light snack but there was tonnes of food on the Amsterdam - Narita leg. And the food was impressive! I took the Japanese option both time and I have to say it was up there with Singapore Air for quality.

Their planes are a little old and so the screens are a little battered but the selection of movies was decent. I really can't think of anything to complain about and was really happy with KLM's service. On our last leg home they did make my check in my carry bag but that was because the flight was full, and it was one of the first bags out so no big deal."|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
578|"This was my first time flying KLM and I thought the experience would've been better than what I endured.  I flew into Helsinki, transfer in Amsterdam, and almost a third or half the plane's luggage was still in Amsterdam.  I understand that things happen and the transfer may have been ""short"" (less than an hour), but they assured me I would have my bag in 24hrs or less (standard messaging from their emails as well say this time limit).  

Imagine my disappointment when my bag had still not showed up at the agreed upon time (the next day at 8:30 PM). I called customer service and asked for an update and they said the delivery was out, left at 8:30 PM, and there is a 2 hour window for delivery.  Okay, so I waited until 2 AM and they never showed up, never called me back. When I tried to call, the customer services was already closed for the night.

Second full day and still no luggage. I call, again, to see what the status update is on my things, and no one has any information, said that I should get it today. I had to talk to two people about helping me figure out where exactly my luggage was - they tried to give me phone numbers to call to see where it could be, but I had to push back - twice - insisting they help by tracking down and calling those numbers and to call me back. (seriously?  this is YOUR job).  A couple hours later and someone calls me back confirming the bag is still at the airport in Helsinki.

Had it been there this whole time? Was it never actually out for delivery? I will never know. I was so fed up with the whole situation and terrible customer compassion and services.  I have never been so disappointed in an airline before.

This situation was unacceptable and there was no courtesy for the trouble and exceeding the baggage delivery promise. The in-flight entertainment had very good options.

The service on the plane was sufficient, kind flight attendants, basic plane food, typical cramped economy seats. So make your decisions with all that in mind."|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
579|"Baggage Fees - Watch Out!   Their website lists a fee for baggage.  However, when you sign up for it, they don't indicate that the fee is for ""extra baggage""; I.e., more baggage than one checked piece of luggage for each passenger.  This ""extra baggage"". cost us over $166 and, as we discovered to our dismay, is non-refundable.  Don't ever pay for baggage on line for this air carrier!

581|"CONSISTENT!
I've flown with KLM numerous times now, they are always consistently excellent!

Most recently my Fiancé and I flew to and from Amsterdam, with absolutely no complaints!! :-) Brilliant! We self-checked in, scanning in the passports then self-checked our bag hold bag...great! I like as little human interaction as possible when I fly-lol...not in a weird way, but just cos my chat would be crap due to nerves...!! HONESTLY!! ;-)

The flights have always been on time (obviously not all credit to them; weather etc...!!) On our recent return it seemed as if the plane was late in arriving...the ground crew got everyone queued up, passports & boarding passes checked and got everyone on board in time to leave-they reaaaaally hustled!! I was v impressed!

I find the flights are completely comparable to ""budget"" airlines price-wise, perhaps a tenner or so more expensive; the service is MUCH superior, though and I'd rather pay a teeeeensy bit extra for tea/juice and stroopwaffels on board! Also O'm a Flying Blue member (free membership!!) which means I get a discount on hold baggage..! BARGAINOUS!

I recommended KLM to a friend today, actually...and I'd happily do so to others!!"|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
582|"Eh.  They are OK I guess.  But quite pricey.  This whole connection with Delta/Northwest has not improved the cost or experience for the traveler.  Especially one who had miles with KLM.  

They are costly flying from A'Dam to Toronto, nevermind to NYC.  

I find the service lacking on this airline compared to others at the same price point.  But at least they speak 10 languages or more on every flight.  Can't beat the Dutch for languages. This airline is no different.  Each announcement will be in every language there's a passport for on the plane.  I promise."|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
583|"I have limited experience with KLM, but the one time that I did fly with them, it was an excellent experience.  I flew from Amsterdam to San Francisco and although it was an exceptionally long flight for me ( 11 hours ), it pretty much went off without a hitch.

Mind you that I did take ambien and managed to sleep almost the entire flight, I felt that the service, food and overall experience was great.  And since they are a Delta partner to Europe, along with Air France, I received all the Skymiles without delay.  I would fly with them again the next time to Europe"|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
584|"If you loose your luggage abroad.... Good luck.  You get this number you can call for updates where there is only people behind a terminal with absolute no willingness to help, with an attitude and frankly useless. No concept of service and understanding you are in a bad situation.

Try twitter, yes. Good luck with that. Every Twitter answer is at leas one hour wait for just silly answers.... ""Here to help"" .... really.

586|Had a connecting flight in Amsterdam en route to Ghana. This is actually a decent airline. Don't have too much to say good or bad. Reliable, professional staff, but slept most of the flight. I'd fly them again|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
587|"I wanted to share the most painful and disappointed and regret experience when I flew with KLM. I took the flight from Kuala Lumpur to Amsterdam by KL810. Leaving KUL at 11:55pm, the flight took almost 13.5 hours, it's a long flight. During the time above ground after meal, the light was intentionally off so that he passengers may sleep. I sat on 23G and was falling asleep deeply. Little that I knew, my small backpack which I placed underneath the seat was taken by other passengers. There are people (apparently a syndicate) who operate to steal passenger's belonging while they are sleeping. I did not loose the bag, but I lost my cash $9,000 US. I assumed the lady who sat on 23D was the one took my bag while I was sleeping. In the meantime They were people laid sleep on the floor as well behind my seat, I did not know why KLM allowed passenger slept on the floor while the light was off. I was so SHOCKED when I reached to the hotel I realized that my money was gone completely. I rushed back to Schiphol airport and talked to Police station and made a Process Vebaal Report. The Schiphol Police was very excellent. They listened carefully of my report. Then I was asked to talk to KLM s security on the departure level, then I talked to one of the customer service. They asked me to wait....I waited for more than an hour. Then there was a male security from KLM approached me. I had a very bad impression with the KLM security who seem did not care. I was so disappointed big time.... Because he simply did not care....

I warn every passengers who take KLM from and to everywhere, specially from Kuala Lumpur... BECAREFUL, BECAREFUL... WATCH YOUR BELONGING.... KEPT YOUR BELONGING ALWAYS WITH YOU EVENTHOUGH YOU GO TO TOILET FOR JUST FEW MINUTES.

I know the face of the woman who sat in the same row with me. The lady is either from China or Malaysia. I flew with KLM on Nov 5th, arrived in Amsterdam on Nov 6th. I assumed big time that the lady who sat on 23D took and browsed my bag while I was sleeping. There were people sleeping on the floor behind my seat. If you took my money you better return the money back to either to KLM or Police station in Schiphol. Whoever took my money, you shall not live peacefully because the money belong to fund orphanage. Whoever you are who operated such a criminal theft action.... REPENT, return the money immediately because that is not your money......

I hope KLM, would do better job, by:
1. Not letting passenger sleep on the floor
2. Flight attendant should do more patrolling
3. Should be revealing the name of the passenger
4. Discuss within the KLM that this is a serious matter.
5. KLM security should be more professional in taking report from the victims.

Thank you for reading and please make known to all people who travel with KLM to be careful... There is a syndicate going on..... WATCH OUT!!!

588|"It's crazy just when I said I was so happy with KLM, everything went wrong when needed to change a ticket  it seems there is a re-occurring error in their website (a bit suspicious) when you try to change tickets (doesn't matter whether you have purchased extra flexi option or have normal ticket where you pay £60 fee..

Don't take me wrong, it does work sometimes and then it's easy as minute work, BUT when it doesn't work, the o my way for me contacting KLM from different country is their online Facebook help!
If I would call charges from the phone to call local KLM are huge, it's cheaper to connect to wifi or rely on mobile internet.. But such a horrible customer service it's shocking!
The smallest thing would be completely ignoring my name and writing it incorrectly. Then it starts properly. After writing them all day at needed for the change (eg ticket number, date suppose to be flying, chosen new date and time, my flying blue number and info that I have flexi option!!!), they would send me link to pay something in Euros! (Means extra bank charges, even though online I would pay in £) but what's even better, they've added extra 80euros or so as a changing fee?! That should NOT be there!
I've replied them again with correct information and that I have included all screenshots with their website error (which incidentally?.. Lasts up until now) and the chosen date and time with correct amount pairs in £... Yet, it's more than 24hours after (30.8.2016 21:29 my reply, now it's 1.9. 17:20) and there is still NO reply?!.. Shocking, especially when it's not the first time this has happened  
My advice is, if you have to fly with them, don't let them take the p*ss! We, as customers pay big money for such services so I don't expect to be treated like that not even at low cost airlines. I understand incidents happen (like due to weather/craft needs repair etc), but as simple as changing a ticket should not be a problem especially when you pay lot of money for that option.
All fellow KLM users lots of luck .. One disappointed long time customer"|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
589|"So far I haven't had any problems with flights as such.
The only flaw they had is in their communication - I've either never received reply from their Facebook support, or I got one but quite late.

When trying to rebook a ticket with their special flexi option, the people on the phone were mostly unhelpful in explaining dates/times/prices and there was no other way how to rebook it. It nade me wonder if the normal option where you pay £60 (instead of £10extra for flexi) for rebook plus the difference in price that day - is easier and it indeed was! I could choose another dates online and see the prices and times clearly! Unless I got it all wrong and I don't understand their offers?..

Their new app is in my opinion worse than the one they had before.

The good about KLM is they are part of Flying Blue  it's quite worth it to register, if you know you will use at least 15 flights (not trips) per year, which will upgrade you to the silver level. From there you get extra luggage (2 luggages, 1 hand and handbag included in the price) and time to time you might get bumped into the business class.

It's not the cheapest option, but since I have extra luggage and they have one of the better times for travelling from Aberdeen (UK), it is my mostly used airline at the moment."|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
590|"Very bad customer service!

It started with exorbitant prices to do a typical short flight (i paid 550 euros for Amsterdam -Lyon, which typically costs 250max). I had to take it as it was the only late flight i found.

They almost yelled at me when i was in the airport (Amsterdam) because i asked an employee where i should go to check my bags. When i spoke with the manager about the employee's behavior... She said: this is Holland, this not the US!!

Then, the plane itself is not as welcoming than other companies in terms of space, staff, etc.

Unbelievable!! Will never fly with them again even if i have to change my trip planning around it."|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
591|"This review is based on my short flight with KLM going from Amsterdam to London Heathrow, which was a lot better than my international flight with them from San Francisco to Amsterdam. Since they're a Dutch company, Schiphol is the main place where their operation is based with plenty of flights through Europe.

Normally, I can't stand short-duration flights on smaller planes. They're usually a lot more cramped with no entertainment onboard but I was really surprised with how comfortable I was on my flight that was supposed to take over an hour, but really lasted only 40 minutes!

Positives:

~ The stewardesses were really lovely and even though it was a short duration flight, offered complementary bags of nachos and biscuits to nibble on.

~ The plane had very comfortable seats for a smaller aircraft, strangely enough more comfortable than the ones on their international flight.

---

Overall, I have to admit I was unimpressed with KLM's international flights as I reviewed my international flight 3 stars. However, I'd definitely be happy to make use of KLM for short duration flights around Europe. As other reviewers have mentioned, their Cityhopper service is pretty awesome with loads of them going out of Amsterdam all across Europe."|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
592|"Flight was cancelled and KLM representative gave me incorrect information about an alternative flight. Ended up having to pay top fee for a flight home. KLM agreed they were at fault....however....they only compensate £250 and the remainder in a flight voucher. Vaild for one year only! As im not a frequent flyer I suspected I wouldn't have opportunity to use the voucher. KLM have refused to extend it.

What poor customer relations when dealing with compensation.

593|"Terrible experience with KLM. We booked the flight to Brussels-Amsterdam-Calgary 6 months in advance. The seating was also booked but they decide 2 days before the departure to change the seats without letting us know. Then it was impossible to change them back.
The flight to Calgary took us there smoothly bit our luggage were missing. It took them not one day but almost three says to have them back! We had to call their non-stop to get an update. That phone bill will cost me a fortune.
On our way back, it was even worse. Our flight to Brussels from Amsterdam was cancelled and we had to take the train!! And since it seems like it is their specialty, they lost another piece of luggage.
Never  again KLM!"|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
594|"The most stressful and upsetting experience.
I booked a flight from Barcelona to Los Angeles with a layover in Amsterdam.
Lines to check in are insane, almost 2 hours to make it to the counter and the Gentleman there said my ticket was cancelled and he couldn't explain why, I went to customer service and they didn't know what happened but after arguing for a while they gave me another ticket but this time the layover was only 30 minutes intead of 2 hours.
In Amsterdam it took me over an hour to go through passport control so of course I missed my flight and once again I had to go to customer service, where line was just about 2 hours, they said they don't have control over that and I was responsible but I showed them the original confirmation when I booked and after fighting for a while they set me on the next flight, I thought that was all but the flight was delayed almost an hour and when we where all in the plane the A/C stopped working and people started to freak out, it got so hot in there, it was 30 anxious minutes but we finally departed,.
In Los Angeles I waited for my luggage over an hour untill they turned off the band and there was no more luggage, and guess what? I had to go to customer service again, this time I was the only one and after filling a paper I went home but I didn't get my luggage untill 3 days after."|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
595|"I flew KLM on a long haul flight to Japan from Dublin, via Schipol airport.

As far as long haul service is concerned, it could of been better. KLM seems to carry it's no frills dutch approach into it's long haul operations which can give a mixed bag of results.

Pros:
- No delays, seems to be a rather consistent performer on timekeeping.
- Very helpful cabin crew. I am a frightened flier and the cabin crew couldn't of been any nicer to me. They moved me to free aisle for privacy and they checked in on me every hour or so.
- Cost effective. My fare was about €200 cheaper then if I had flew with British Airways or a Japanese carrier.
- Free booze on long haul flights!

Cons:
- Ground staff were not very helpful. Check in process was an absolute joke. The self-service check in terminal could not locate my bags and the transfer desk was overrun with queuing. KLM staff did not offer much assistance.
- Onboard, the entertainment/VOD system was faulty for my trip to Japan with an unresponsive remote. On returning flight, the entertainment system was faulty for everyone and had to eventually be turned off.
- A previous reviewer mentioned that KLM has as little human interaction as is possible which I don't think is an altogether good thing. It is impossible to contact them via phone (I had to use public social media) for emergencies/inquiries. Also, when their check in terminals are not working, it's even harder to track down a KLM staff member to get help. That is not ideal to be honest."|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
596|"My favorite airline! Royal dutch airlines :)
I red the reviews here on yelp, and i couldnt help it to write one aswell. Offcourse KLM is more expensive than a low cost airline. But you really get what you pay for. Lets begin with safety. Safety is the most important thing, if you ask me, when you fly with an airline. KLM doenst take risks. Same thing for when you strand somewhere, KLM Will always be there for you and fund a suitable sollution for both parties. Compare to other airlines.. Thats a excellent plus.
The staff, Cabin and ground, are kind and never hasitate to help you. Same for problems you fund during your flight, they Will always be there to find a solution.
And offcourse we dont have big fancy airplanes with a big bar or the most outrageos choices. We are down to earth and human. Thats way more valuable....
Ps: people do not understand that not the airline chooses the gate...  Its the Airport who schedule the flights to the different gates... So dont blame the airline!!"|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
597|"What a bad experience with customer service. After following their instructions explicitly on changing a flight in a manner that they said would invoke no fees because it was within 24 hours (they said to request a refund and rebook) I am now out $1100 in "" fees"" and still do not have  seats on the new flight. Never trust what they tell you.

Update. Took 30 days but it got sorted out. Delta is handling their customer service but has no authority. Referrals to Amsterdam took about a week to turn around and were turned down even with recommendations to approve from supervisors at the call centre. As I said, they finally got it sorted out."|klm-royal-dutch-airlines

They even have the nerve to push this to Twitter and Facebook, see message below and link.   The staff on Twitter and Facebook just push it off on someone else.  I have been chased around between making expensive calls to Amsterdam to both the airline and airport and all I get is the run around.

601|I have flown KLM several times now from Australia to either England or Amsterdam and am very impressed with their customer service.  It really is the thing I like best about the airline and it really counts for a lot.  I usually pay extra for either exit row or economy comfort seats and it does make a difference.  The coffee is great.. typically strong in the Dutch fashion.  I am particularly happy to see that they now list allergens on main meals (I am Coeliac and vegetarian so usually have to take a risk on the Asian Vegetarian meal as the Gluten Free option is not vegetarian).. this really does make a difference to those of us who have Coeliac, allergies or intolerances!  Unfortunately I'm less happy with KLM's partner airlines which are utilised on the leg out of Australia but I will still keep travelling KLM!|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
602|Direct flight from Amsterdam to Los Angeles was cancelled without explanation. We were eventually rerouted through Toronto on Air Canada but then that flight was delayed by 2 hours leaving us with a 7 hour layover in Toronto. After flying from Nairobi our 3 kids (ages 6-9) were absolutely exhausted. No apology or explanation was ever given.|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
603|"4 Stars for International flights, 2 stars for intra-Europe flights. How does that average out to 4 stars? It doesn't. The International flights are far more important than domestic flights, so the intra-Europe flights don't even fit into the equation.

Europeans are spoiled with real airlines. Don't believe me? Take a USA domestic flight on any of our ""fine"" airlines from say.. Columbus Ohio to Wichita Kansas, with a change of planes in Atlanta. Complete crap. Air travel in Europe still makes you feel important. In the US, you are treated like a terrorist whether you are one or not.

I've flown on KLM a few times for International flights, and I have been impressed both times. Super clean aircraft (747-400 Combi) and super friendly flight attendants. The dinner on my last flight was a curry fish dish which I was really apprehensive about, but it turned out to be delicious! Maybe it was the unlimited free beers I had in me, but I really enjoyed it.

A word of warning about the ""Economy Comfort"" seating. Don't waste your money. I'm  6'4"", 260lbs (typical American-size). I upgraded my seat on the way to Europe for 100 Euro, but was not able to do so on the way back. You can give me all the leg room you want, but if the seat is still only wide enough for Kate Moss, it doesn't do me any good. On the return flight, a standard seat gave me enough leg room to make me glad I didn't spend the extra money. I could have gone with the very reasonable 350 Euro Business Class upgrade, but in the end, I was too cheap."|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
604|Sadly, KLM is all about making money.  They pack folks in like sardines, even with paying for extra legroom in the exit row.  The aisles on the plane I flew on were so narrow, people were constantly bumping into me, stepping on my feet.  The topper was I was unable to make the last leg of my flight and they charged me $300 to retrieve my luggage. (They also smashed the corner of my hardcase.) I understand a fee but this is highway robbery.  Two stars for a decent meal and entertainment system.  Not worth it tho -wont be flying KLM again.|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
605|We had a great flight with KLM as a Delta partner. We were offered the upgrade to economy class early (day before our flight) by email- and I had been worried about that.  It would have been nice if they coordinated better with Delta and I could have upgraded before my trip (and not had to worry I might be stuck in coach)- so I am taking one star away for that, but everything else was great.  The food was much better than Delta, and there was something coming to my seat almost every hour- drinks, snacks, warm towels (I really like the warm towels).  The air hosts were very good, and very helpful and friendly, and it was just a nice experience.|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
606|My favourite airline departing from Amsterdam. Good connections, friendly staff, ok-ish food compared to other airlines. Good entertainment system, goid seat pitch, helpdesk via social media. Two thumbs up! :)|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
607|"KLM is a sister to Delta and the primary reason that I fly with them, however I prefer Delta of KLM is most aspects. Here's the rundown:
1.) KLM has nicer lounges than Delta. By nicer, I mean they offer more food.
2.) Delta's business class is a significant upgrade from economy, however the only benefit to business class with KLM is reading material and food (maybe a little extra legroom), but the seats are the same as economy.
3.) Delta's upgrade system is much better. Delta upgrades to allow business/first class to be full. KLM only upgrades medallion members if coach is full. There are usually several 'business' class seats open when I fly KLM.
4.) KLM generally has better in flight food: sandwiches as compares to Delta's peanut/pretzel/cookie option."|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
608|We just flew from sfo to Amsterdam. It was a real long flight, my entertainment system volume did not work despite multiple times resetting . I got a €30 to buy some inflight stuff . I think I deserve something more than that for a time that was hard to kill.|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
609|"I have flown on KLM numerous times. They seem to get better every time. The food is good, and they serve food and beverages almost every hour. Whiskey, Grand Marnier, Amarula and Cognac are complementary not to mention Heineken beer and wine.
Last flight, I had at least 4 inches between my knees and the seat in front of me. The overhead luggage space was plenty, too. Four of us carried a large carry- on and a 'personal' bag.
The on-flight entertainment was really great with a lot of good movies or TV shows to choose from, like 'The Office'. Video games are also available, or what I always do- language courses.
The staff really go the extra mile on KLM. I have never left short of satisfied. The last flight AMS-SFO was a real pleasure."|klm-royal-dutch-airlines

611|"Actually, I am sorry to write this review cause I expected so much better and was looking forward flying back from Cape Town to Hanover.
But what can I say except: I am highly disappointed and will probably never ever book KLM again.
My negative points are: I sat in the middle and there was a metal box underneath the seat, that ment that I could not stretch my feet as much as I wanted and I sat quite in a strange position during the flight.
The board personal was not exceptional friendly as I know from other companies and one was yawning without even covering her mouth up. Thanks for that!

I just drowsed off to sleep (finally) when I was awoken by a stewardess who stormed up and down screaming: seat belts, seat belts and lifting up my blanket to check if I my seat belt was fastend!
Then, maybe one and a half hour later all of the sudden my table tray dropped down and woke me up once again. I looked up and saw a roll placed on it.? Was it breakfast time yet? 10 minutes later they passed by again, asking ( not in a low voice): ice cream or sandwich? What is going on? It was not even 5 am yet....
Afterwords, finally, nothing else has happend and we were just able to doze.
Also: the flight attendees in our row never used one of these trolleys, they served everything freestyle with their hands and it seemed at times that the whole staff was on their 1st shift ever!

Positive: the food. Very delicious and plenty!"|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
612|"I slept through most of our flight to Amsterdam, but I enjoyed every minute of the return trip.

* Solid entertainment offerings (squeezed in 3 recent movies), plus choice of many free newspapers as you board;
* Surprisingly good food (and lots of it; the flight attendants must have served 4 different meals/snacks/drinks);
* Very friendly and efficient service;
"" On-time performance (even slightly early arrival on the outbound route);
* Spotless planes;
* Humane security personnel.

Best of all, my investment in Economy Comfort seats paid off. Much more legroom. I would recommend grabbing the pairs next to the stairs on 747s for the extra space between the seat and the wall.

The only negative: Schiphol security moves you from one desolate seating area to another after they subject you to the machines. There is a bathroom, but that's about it. Not even a kiosk to buy water or a magazine. Is it a security thing?"|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
613|Wow folks are really down on KLM. I think they are rather good compared to the major airlines I've been on. Given the international flight is not too different from what Im used to (just as cramped) but the Cityhopper service is excellent, with nice wide seats, comfortable and great service. If they can bring the rest of their flights to that level this would be an awesome airline.|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
614|"I left an item on board and while I accept that this is my responsibility....I was stopped at the gate of my connecting flight and told they would have it for me when I passed through Schipol airport.  I left thinking WOW what great customer service and the whole week in Europe I wasn't concerned.

When Passing through Schipol again...there was NO RECORD of my item.  When I contacted KLM they said anything beyond 24 hours and they turn it over to Schipol please contact them.  When I contact Schipol Lost and Found they said we don't have a record of it contact KLM.

My conclusion is that someone KLM is either incompetent i.e. its sitting on someone's desk and they didn't follow through on what they promised...or worse someone at KLM is a thief and they are enjoying a new Ipad.

Either way its bad customer service for a number of reasons:
1. Why find something only to 'lose' it again.
2.  I've been given the runaround like you would believe and I didn't get the impression that anyone at KLM is doing anything but saying ""its our policy""...blah...blah...blah.

At this point its not that I'm out the money.  I had already replaced this version Ipad with an Ipad3...what angers me is that SOMEONE FOUND IT...now they claim they don't have a record of it."|klm-royal-dutch-airlines

It would seem that if no one wants these later flights...the airlines should not offer them...but when did airlines have common sense? The personnel who answer the phone are pleasant but have no ability to help passengers. Clearly, KLM is not about customer care at all but about how to fleece the customer best.

When I reach the airport, they tell me the flight is delayed and I won't be able to make the connecting flight and they can put me on another flight to my destination--totally fine. So I go to where they tell me to go to get that sorted out. I proceed to wait for AN HOUR AND A HALF for the guy to put me on a different flight. He proceeds to tell me (quite rudely) that the only possible flight--the one that the other person had told me about--has already left and that I should have come to him an hour ago (you mean that hour I waited in line??).

In short, he blamed me for his absolute incompetence in putting the 3 people who were in front of me in line on different flights and telling me that it was my fault for not getting to him an hour earlier even though I had already wasted that hour waiting for him to deal with THREE PEOPLE. THERE WERE ONLY THREE PEOPLE IN FRONT OF ME. He then booked me a hotel and snottily yelled ""YOUR WELCOME"" as I walked away.

I have flown all over the world and have never been treated so badly at an airport. Absolutely NEVER. I am never flying KLM again."|klm-royal-dutch-airlines

620|"Oh KLM, let me count the ways in which you absolutely fail in customer service.

1) Serving a vegetarian a ham sandwich and a fruit scone. ""The scone is vegetarian"". Yup. Lying beside a HAM SANDWICH.

2) Throwing said sandwich without even checking first if I wanted it. Yup, I love having food hurled at me, especially when it's a ham sandwich.

3) Do you only hire rude air stewards? Is that  your speciality?

4) After delays (not your fault) - our plane arrives at Schipol thankfully next to our next plane. It's great - we can watch our luggage being offloaded as we taxi away from the airport. Thankfully, the rude staff point out, because I am a moron, that of course I won't get my luggage on the plane, because our first plane was late. Silly me, for entrusting my luggage to you.

5) Thanks for also telling me off for storing my (liquid) steroids in the same missing luggage, leaving me devoid of the medication I use on a daily basis, and insulting me simultaneously. I keep forgetting that you trust your customers like morons.

6) Offering nothing to cover us for our lack of luggage that you left on our behalf in Amsterdam - and then when prodded, $25. $25 will barely buy my a toothbrush let alone clothes to last until whenever my luggage arrives.

7) Ignoring the staff button thing when we pressed it frequently trying to get some attention from the staff on the flight over. No worries - I'll come and find YOU.

8) Super loud announcements that near damn deafen your customers as you turn the volume up to 100%

Fortunately (and I think the whole flipping out over my missing medication helped to be fair) our luggage was rushed through and arrived late the following day, but I'll be honest KLM vbar one senior purser, your staff are rude, your service sucks ass and you serve vegetarians ham, despite prior warnings not to do so. Next time, I'll spend my hard earned money on a better quality airline than you."|klm-royal-dutch-airlines

They seemed to be more than adequately staffed but I almost never saw the stewards.  They seemed to be hiding somewhere.  On the way over, my husband was asleep so they didn't leave him food, the steward had quickly moved to the next aisle when I asked her for food (3 times as she was ignoring me) and she finally barked back she would get it later.  Once I did manage to hunt them down and the steward did her best to ignore me talking to her.  Ignoring customers is something they excelled at. On the rare occasion the stewards came down the aisle with their carts it was so fast you couldn't even hand them the trash. Once I accidentally dropped something on the floor, I bend down to pick it up to hand to the steward, she saw me do this, but by the time I picked it up, she was long gone.  We travel a LOT and this is the first airline I had to throw my trash on the floor on both legs to and from the U.S.  The only time the stewards took their time in the aisles was to block the aisles between 15 and 45 minutes prior to landing so no one could use the bathrooms.  This is the first airline I've flown where both toilet paper and kleenex were out of stock...TWICE.  The food was also among the worst I've had.  KLM wins the worst airline ever award!|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
624|They changed the food! While it still is not very good, it is a improvement! I still order the Hindu meal...I love the strange looks I get when they deliver it to me, no dot here sister!|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
625|I fly a lot on KLM , 44 flights a year... I love the soothing boarding and landing music...the planes are new and nice for the most part...Dutch crew can be cold at times and will never make a fuss over you, at all! The food sucks ( always) and snacks consist of smoked almonds, ice cream or some cracker thing...Recently had a flight cancelled and was treated superbly by KLM customer service and put up in a Kool hotel. I don't mind having my flight cancelled on my way to Africa , but the first time my flight is cancelled on the way home to Houston, well that will be my last flight with KLM ever! But I like them, just have flown much better airlines, sorry KLM!|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
626|"I had a ticket for myself and my two children, to fly from Nairobi, to Amsterdam and to connect into the US on the evening of December 3, 2014. Our tickets were purchased through a travel agency. On the day of our flight, I attempted online check-in 3 different times, each time using a different computer. Each time I tried I got a message stating that I could not check in online for this flight. Eventually it was simply time to leave for the airport. The traffic was horrible in Nairobi that night. We ran into a jam but still arrived at the airport a full 70 minutes before our flight. There was no traffic sign indicating KLM departures, no door sign, no indication of where to enter for our KLM flight anywhere outside the international departures terminal.  This lack of signage definitely slowed us down. When we eventually got to the correct entrance, the supervisor at the door refused to let us in. This supervisor stated 'This flight is closed' . I stated that we had tickets and we had seat assignments; we should be allowed on. He stated that we were too late and that I needed to go to the reservations desk to re-book. This was still 60 minutes before the scheduled departure. Another party walked in the terminal and proceeded to go through the pre-flight screenings. As I witnessed this I complained to the supervisor. Why is this person getting on the flight? the response that I got was ""He checked in online. You should have checked in online"" . This angered me because I tried at least 3 different times to check in online!  It did not work! I asked two other staff in the area to please let us on the flight with no success.
I am a mother with two school age children, each of us had only one bag to check, I had my passports in hand and seat assignments. My final plea to the supervisor was met with yet another no . Instead he directed us to an office to make alternate reservations. We go there and the place was empty! Once again, we go back to the KLM check in area, for help with this problem. This time we are directed outside the terminal to another office. Once there, I explained our predicament to the attendant, who was unable to help us with anything. She explained that our ticket was booked through Delta, and that she could not re-book us on that computer system. She did not understand why the supervisor at the entrance would not let us in.
The following morning, I called the customer service number for KLM and asked to get checked in for my flight. The operator said that she could not help me, I asked to speak to her supervisor, who told me the same thing. I did the same with customer service numbers for Skymiles and for Delta. Nobody could check me in for the flight. So I had to take my chances on getting to the airport extra early in order to check in at the airport. There were problems with getting us checked in at the airport KLM desk, but we finally had an agent who could help us get checked in.
My experience with KLM in Africa was nothing but a wild goose chase.  I was misdirected so many times and wound up spending extra for lodging and food, not to mention the hefty ""change fee"".  
After returning to my home I contacted KLM customer service. The response that I got from KLM was very disappointing.  It essentially stated, use our website, which I did, but it did not work.  Or call our support team, which due to the time difference, was not open when I needed them. When I eventually did get through to them, they were not allowed to check us in via telephone for security reasons.  
My Final Words: I will avoid KLM flights from here forward."|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
627|"Like they say, ""Never Again"". KLM should really help their hostesses to speak engels a little better. Though I can read and speak a some dutch. What I experienced on KLM was shocking. Were these people asleep in primary school? Also they really should relax the weight rules for the hostesses. Some looked as if they may snap in two. I felt compelled to give my inflight meal to the hostesses. They looked like they needed something to eat. As well as a different style of uniform. The brown leggings they wear make me feel ill for some reason. The major reason why I do not like KLM other than the superficial. Is that they tend to lose luggage very easily. Since the blue clad ""KLM official"" threateningly told me to put away (I was removing the sd card, not taking pictures) my camera in the waiting area. I later witnessed this ""official"" grab his broom and dustpan and sweep the floor. It amazes me how police powers have been given to everyone these days. Perhaps if the KLM people would focus on making their service better, rather directing their janitors to threaten customers maybe they might rank a bit higher as an airline. I have flown with the arrogant dutch airway a total of eight times. Each time it's the same old story. Dirty planes, lack of english speaking staff, arrogant hostesses, revolting food, teenage looking pilots, lost luggage and the oh so wonderful Schipol prison like customs experience. I give two stars total for the Royal pain."|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
628|"I have created my own special catchphrase for this airline:
""KLM-NEVER AGAIN!""
Let me explain...............
As a frequentish flying I have become accustomed to a certain level of service on board long haul flights and unfortunately KLM just doesn't cut the mustard.
We recently took a 10 hour flight from CapeTown to Hannover with a stop off in Amsterdam. As newlyweds we decided to ask if there was any chance of an upgrade and were but laughed at by the check in agent and sales desk clerk. So strike one for customer service.
On board it became very evident that this crew was not organised. Mostly they wandered around with no real purpose smiling dementadly at the passengers. Not to be too personal but they did seem to be forcing smiles too much and it seemed like they had just arrived from a customer training course and thats all they took from it..... Strike two.
As my wife is a vegetarian the usual deal is that she gets her food first and then we wait a couple of minutes and then everyone else who hasn't ordered special meals gets their food. But not here, we waited nearly 45 minutes before they got organised enough to distribute our meals (which I have to say were pretty decent for airline food.) and then waited for at least another 15 minutes before any drinks were served. I say ""served"" but I guess a better phrase would be ""handed out"" as no trolleys were visible and the hostesses carried 2 or 3 drinks at a time from an undetermined location. After we had all finished it took at least another half hour before they came around, again carrying 2 or 3 trays at once. Who stole the trolleys?? Strike three.
At around 2am the lights were dimmed and for the first time in my life I was able to doze off on an aeroplane. Zzzzzzzzzzz. And then suddenly ""SEAT BELTS, SEAT BELTS!!!!!!!"" What the hell!! I woke up thinking we were crashing to see the hostesses running up and down the aisles screaming at the passengers, blankets flying everywhere. I know this is a security issue and I understand that it needs to be done but unless I hear ""Brace,brace"" in the following 2 minutes there is NO reason to run around shouting on an aeroplane, waking everyone up. Anyway after that interlude I managed to fall back to sleep. Zzzzzzzzzzz. Until as if in a dream, I hear ""Sandwich or ice-cream, sandwich or ice-cream?"" Ummmm thats a different choice. Now I am all up for odd and unusual things but ice-cream for breakfast is one I've not something I have been offered before. But heres the rub.......... it was 4AM and this wasn't breakfast!!!!!!  Why on earth, two and a half hours having dinner and two hours away from breakfast would any sane person need an ice-cream or another sandwich is beyond me. But then maybe Im missing something. I though that smoking was banned on airlines and as far as I can remember smoking dope was ALWAYS banned so theres not even that as an excuse. So strike four and five and six. (I know that there are only 3 strikes in baseball, but 30000 feet in the air and no exit, you have to give a few more........
This being the first time I've ever flown KLM I have nothing else to base this experience on apart from KLMs competitors and let me say that if there is an option to fly with someone else, even if its more expensive, longer or has more connections  Im going with the competitor, because (for me at least)
""KLM-NEVER AGAIN."""|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
629|My experience with this airline today has not been good.  First, they schedule my flight to land at Amsterdam at 7:30am.  Then, they schedule my connecting flight to board at 7:50am, on the complete opposite side of the airport.  I ran hoping I didn't miss my plane back to the U.S., with a heavy ski coat on carrying a heavy bag.  Then, we get to the gate.  What a joke.  This system is poorly managed.  I stand for 30 minutes in this like to get through the gate security because they poorly managed getting people through it.  There are more complaints I have about that, such as not having the bins out for people to put their things in, letting the flight crew cut in front of everyone, not being consistent (I was the only person I saw asked to take my shoes off after the fact).  Extremely annoying.  I wish there were more of a market with airlines offering choices so that you don't get stuck with crappy service because there are no other options.|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
630|"The Dutch. i used to think that they were Germans (""Deutsch"" being German for ""German"") and i accidentally called a very distant German cousin that in sheer ignorance (sue me, i was in elementary school! haha). They're a people that are known for their windmills, wooden clogs, tulips and more recently, legal marijuana and prostitution. However, they're a very intelligent, multicultural and open people. Same goes for their national airlines: KLM Royal Dutch Airlines

i was going to Kenya for a church mission trip and our itinerary included in/outbound flights between LAX and Amsterdam with KLM for a layover

The planes are clean and modern with personal entertainment systems installed on all coach seats at your disposal. All the plane crew members speak impeccable English (hardly with any discernible accent too) and are charming and attentive with all smiles. The food was also pretty good. i'm usually bleh about airplane food, but maybe it was luck or something, but i rather enjoyed most of the food i had with them

i don't plan on visiting the Netherlands any time soon, but it will be a good ride over with KLM"|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
631|KLM is probably the worst airline company that I have ever dealt with. I am currently on a multi-city tour in Europe and they missed both of my luggage transfers so far. From Budapest to Glasgow - KLM decided that it would be OK to land the plane from Budapest at the very end of the terminal and the Glasgow plane at the very end of another terminal with a 35 minute transfer time. Not to mention that we had to clear the security again because UK is not part of the border-free Schengen area. From Glasgow to Madrid - My flight from Glasgow to Amsterdam was delayed due to heavy fogs, which I don't blame them, and was asked to speak with the ground crews to reschedule my flight from Amsterdam to Madrid. After I spoke to the KLM customer rep, she informed me that the Amsterdam to Madrid flight was delayed so I would be able to make the flight and was falsely told that my luggage was already on the plane. Else I would probably stay in Amsterdam for the day and fly to Madrid in the evening. I would highly recommend that KLM to analyze the transfer times to allow enough time for people to walk from one terminal to another and give the luggage a chance to actually make the transfer flight. Luckily, I will be flying Lufthansa for the rest of trip.|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
632|Please avoid if you can. Their baggage handling is crap and they will always end up missing or wrongly tagging bags. You would end up stranded with some of you baggage missing. Worst customer service, expensive tickets, worst airport as lay over(Amsterdam), worst partner 'Delta' where clerks dont know the rules themselves. I was told i will be getting bassinet and then at airport the Delta clerk said there is not such thing called bassinett in Delta airlines egggggggggggg. AVOID these looters.|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
633|I booked my flight through KLM 6 months before my flight date.  My flight from US to Europe was fine, however the return flight I was put on stand by after being told that they over booked the flight.  How does someone who booked 6 months in advance get put on stand by?  Keeping my cool, I ask what I can do and the representative tells me to step outside and have a seat, when it gets close to final boarding they will call my name if a seat opens up.  10 mins to door closing, I decide to walk up to the booth and start inquiring about another flight out of Amsterdam to the US.  Upon giving them my boarding pass, they tell me that I have a seat assigned to me already.  I asked why I wasn't called to be notified of this and she tells me its because I never gave my boarding pass to them.  Um, shouldn't they have taken my boarding pass the first time I talked to them?  I don't know.  All I know is that if didn't decide to inquire about my flight then I would have missed my boarding.  The agent didn't even seem sorry for any of the confusion they caused.  I flew out pretty annoyed and certain I probably won't ever fly with KLM again unless the deal is much much better than other airliners.|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
634|"If there were zero stars, that would be my choice. KLM won't tell you the following:
you may have been transfered to a Delta phone site (KLMs partner in overseas flights which sells KLMs seats.) Delta will confirm & accept payment for seat reservations months before the flight, which KLM later does not honor.  Upon complaint (after your hideous trip) you learn ""KLM seat assignments, requested by Delta, are requests and not always confirmed by KLM. Furthermore, Delta is unable to access or request seats up to 24 hours prior to a KLM flight departure."" That quote is from Megan Buchanan, Coordinator, Corporate Customer Care, Delta Airlines. BUT THEY DON'T TELL YOU THAT WHEN CONFIRMING YOUR SEAT RESERVATION & ACCEPTING PAYMENT FOR YOUR TICKETS.
Then you get on the plane. The seats in both Economy & Economy Plus sections on SFO/Amsterdam flights are, by actual measurement, 17.5 inches wide. I'm a 140 lb. woman, and  20"" wide from arm to arm. I literally had to fly overnight for 10+ hours with my arms in front of me in a seat that reclined only 3"" or about 5 degrees. If this were a Southwest hop from SFO to LAX one might expect that. But an overnight, 6000 mi. flight? Any other business would be required TO DISCLOSE SUCH A MATERIAL FACT to customers before they purchased. Window & aisle seats allow for a little spillover. But the middle seats will not accomodate a normal size woman, let alone anyone bigger. Both Delta & KLM have the right to run their businesses as they see fit. But they do not have to right to WITHHOLD THIS VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION FROM CUSTOMERS WHEN SELLING THEIR SERVICES.  This is a violation of the implied warranty of good faith and fair dealing at best, if not blatant breach of contract."|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
635|Well, I'm on the fence with this airline......  First off, on the long haul flights, you DO NOT have control of your own air - it is centralized for the entire plane and is frequently hot.  The staff are excellent, but their website sucks.  It is very user un-friendly.  And, don't even try to get phone call assistance once you have booked - you will be routed to some country where they don't understand you and you certainly don't understand them!  I also don't like the fact that you must first purchase a ticket before you are allowed to choose your seat.  Even after paying an additional $250 per ticket for Comfort Select seats with more leg room - the airline will still bump you from your chosen seat when they feel the urge.  My son and his girlfriend were bumped from their side/window seats and forced to sit with a group in the middle of the plane, even after having the seats pre-booked, confirmed and paid for THREE months prior to the flight.  The jury is out if he will receive any compensation for this change.....  The food is OK, if you like a curry, pizza or Italian (standard European fare).   Even though they do have entertainment screens on all seats and a fairly good selection, they need to be replaced with anti-glare screens and to adjust properly when the passenger in front of you reclines their seat.  The bright interior cabin lights are also left on for most of the trip, which is not relaxing, and contributes as well to the inability to view the entertainment screen.  After listing all my concerns, this won't be my first choice of airlines in the future.|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
636|"My wife and I recently completed a wonderful trip to Holland and Portugal.  However KLM did their best to make it a bad vacation.  They started out by weighing our carry-on luggage on a flight from San Francisco to Amsterdam.  When our carry-ons were ""overweight"" they told me I had to check both bags.  When I asked the baggage agent how much the bags would cost, she said she didn't know - a baggage agent who has been trained by KLM should know the answer.  She said just check them and then go to the Delta counter to pay for them.  When I got to the Delta counter I was told it was $100 per bag.  If the agent had been honest, I could have consolidated the two bags and still carried on one, but KLM is money hungry.  So the start to our trip was impacted.  We also paid $205 each to upgrade our seats.  We did have more legroom, but the seats were very narrow so it made a 10 1/2 hour flight very uncomfortable in upgraded seats.  We paid a total of $820 for those seats.  (2 seats each way).  Our next KLM leg was Amsterdam to Lisbon and once again we had to pay 55 euros for a carry-on that was ""too heavy""  our next leg was Lisbon back to Amsterdam and one more time I had to pay for a ""too heavy"" carry-on bag.  This time they managed to break my brand new computer by smashing the screen with rough handling.  Our final leg was a return from Amsterdam to San Francisco and one again we had to pay for ""overweight"" carry-on.

This was bad, but to make things worse, when we got home, I went on the KLM website to call customer service.  Guess what, the KLM website only has a customer service number that goes to Delta, their flying partner and I could get little satisfaction from them  I decided to try an file a claim on line from the website.  I did file 2 claims/complaints.  The one concerning the broken computer if did hear back from saying that I would hear from them sometime in the next 2-4 months.  The really weird one was the complaint I had about their upgraded seats.  I file it on the KLM site and got a response from them saying I had to contact KLM regarding this and gave me a link to the KLM website (where I had filed the original complaint) and signed the e-mail KLM Airlines.  What a pathetic joke.

The only positive thing I can say is they did feed us on all flights and the food was OK for airline food.  The flight attendants were nice.   That is why I rated them a 2 instead of a 1.  I would highly recommend that you avoid KLM if at all possible."|klm-royal-dutch-airlines
637|"Flying during the pandemic has upended many things. However, Lufthansa's business class still serves their meals course by course.

The filet steak was served medium rare. The sauce was great. The gratin potatoes decadent.  Awesome!

While lackluster when compared to many other flagship airlines pre-pandemic, other airlines have gone to pre-packaged 1 that meals in their business class during CoVid19. This gives Lufthansa a distinct edge during the crisis.

They have swapped several procedures--preflight wipe for your seat in lieu of a hot towel for example. No more cart of goodies for self serve mid flight. No more pajamas.

Grateful to be flying again."|lufthansa
638|"We had a great experience with Lufthansa.
Service was great as well as the prices because we got my ticket kind of last minute.

They arranged our seats together without charging any extra fee.

For an hour and twenty minutes of flight, they still gave us a sandwich and drinks to all. Which nowadays you don't see with others."|lufthansa
639|Chase eventually refunded me after 6 months of going back and forth.  They deserve credit for eventually doing right while Lufthansa would not make any attempts to do as much.|lufthansa
640|U.S. Soldier banned from going to Europe when COVID-19 travel ban came out.  Lufthansa and Chase Rewards refuse to refund me ands say I can only use credit to fly on Lufthansa in next year.  I will be deployed in that time frame.  So, they screwed me over and I am out $600+ for those tickets.|lufthansa
641|"Frankfurt FlugZeug!
This is the national airline of Germany, doing it German style. When I flew through Frankfurt on Lufthansa, they put us on a pretty small plane, and we were delayed about an hour due to fog. I guess I can't blame Lufthansa for that. But the flight crew was good about keeping us informed in English and in German as to what the situation was.
They offered soda and drinks, like any other flight, along with a sandwich. Der nom.
I flew in to Frankfurt with Lufthansa from Houston, on to Budapest, all on Lufthansa. I was less than impressed with the goodies you get on a Lufthansa flight- other airlines offer masks, slippers, etc. when you fly internationally or transatlantic, but from Lufthansa- nein!
The planes were clean, the lavatories were adequate. I got to my destination safely with all my luggage. No news is good news on a flight."|lufthansa
642|"Flew round trip from Frankfurt to Brussels and wAs very pleased with our first experience.  

Baggage check was mostly assisted self service with friendly staff to help.

Gate agents kept flyers aware of any changes and handled their crowds professionally.  

Flight crew were attentive and the jet service was Airbus 300.  Quite comfortable.   I'd recommend Lufthansa anytime based on my experience"|lufthansa
643|I booked Lufthansa for my Frankfurt  - Brussels flights. The plane was very basic  and simple  which js normal for a 40min flight.. it was weird to me that your snack is handed to you at the door when you enter the plane lol but why not... I was carrying my bags so didn't grab one so I'm not a fan, bring it to my seat please lol.|lufthansa
644|"Do NOT fly Lufthansa if you have any type of life-threatening PEANUT/NUT/TREE NUT allergy. The flight staff on our F class plane was not professional, not respectful, and not understanding. The male flight attendant, John Doe, who I believe was German was rude, belittling, and unprofessional.

RED FLAG: Four months prior to flying I called to notify them of my fatal peanut allergy, Lufthansa said that the accommodations would be left to the flight staffs' discretion, and that was pretty much all they had to say. Not the best response ever.

At the gate, I informed the gate agents of the allergy, and then the flight staff. Onboard, the first flight attendant a woman said they would do their best to accommodate me. But then John Doe came up to me at my seat and said in the most indifferent and nonchalant tone: ""We will serve a nut (peanut bar) on the flight to everyone. There is nothing we can do. You can get off the plane or stay and assume the risk."" (The flight was only 1 hr 40 min. I might add)

A: Given that we had two other connecting flights getting off the plane wasn't an option, though it would have been nice to have been told on the phone four months prior that Lufthansa's policy was really more of we cannot, will not, and do not want to accommodate/help/assist passengers in any way shape or form with fatal allergies. Then perhaps the plane change back then would have been an option.

B: I do not assume risk, because of the staff as I have been told by legal counsel, could have used reasonable discretion and not served the nut bar for the short flight. A flight which they were already not serving specialty drinks or any meals because of some other error/incompetence that had taken place.

So as the plane took off I had my Epi-Pen (AKA serious medication) out and ready to use.

RED FLAG: About 10 minutes into the flight the staff served the peanut bar to everyone, not a single person nearby me was told of my allergy, and no wipes were provided for me to wipe down the seat/table/etc. as most all other airlines with good name recognition do.

RED FLAG: *I had figured may out of common decency the staff might have waited until the middle or end of the trip to serve the snack but I was sorely mistaken.

Five minutes after the nutbar was served I had a life-threatening peanut allergy attack and required the Epi-Pen medication, which thankfully worked well and I managed to get off the flight in one piece still breathing. Even though the flight staff didn't even bother to ask once I disclosed my nut allergy if I had an Epi-Pen and where it would be located, another RED FLAG.

RED FLAG: A word of caution even though some flights are cheap, it's not always great to go with them, such as European-considered F Class Lufthansa. You get treated like a street dog with a disease, untouchable, worthy of disrespect, and unkindness. Lufthansa I am a human being with rights, you will never again get me or anyone in my large network of social connections to ever fly with you again.

RED FLAG: Lufthansa is the worst possible airline. Please understand that a life-threatening allergy means yes the person can die. Moms, dads, children, and families who know someone with the fatal peanut allergy please do yourself a favor and choose a different airline that cares about your wellbeing and comfort.

I write this review in all of its entirety to ensure that other people, especially young children or pregnant mothers with peanut allergies do not have to experience the inhumane and disrespectful treatment I received at the hands of Lufthansa Airlines and Assoc. Staff."|lufthansa
645|"I have had the worst customer service experience with Lufthansa. I and my husband booked a flight from NYC to Israel, with our 3 cats. Before booking the flight, we triple checked there were 3 available spots for our cats. Two of them were booked in the hold, on my name, and the third cat was booked in the cabin, on my husband's name. As agreed with Lufthansa. A few days before the fight, I found out by chance, that the cat in the cabin, wasn't booked properly. Lufthansa's agent did a mistake and didn't book him all the way to Israel. Only from Germany to Israel and not from NY as it should be. Since then, we have been on the phone with Lufthansa, every day, sometimes 4 hours a day, asking to resolve a problem we didn't solve. We changed the day of the flight to Sep 13th, in order to get the spots, but no solution has been provided. No one cares. The representatives often hand up the phone when they get tired of the situation. Some of then are being very rude. None of them offered a solution, although we have spoken with many supervisors. 3 days ago I spoke with supervisor Diana and she said the only way to solve the problem and get the third cat on board, would be to upgrade to business. She also said it would be at my expense. I said I think it wouldn't be appropriate but I would do it anyway because I wanted to get this done. I asked Diana to please call me back if the call would be dropped, Diana said she would upgrade me quickly and that should be ok. The call was dropped or hanged? Diana didn't call me back. We called right after and asked to upgrade as agreed with Diana. but the rep that took the call said Dinan wrote in the notes: ""the customer didn't agree to pay the upgrade"" This wasn't true. I said I would pay, although I wasn't happy about it.  We have also emailed customer relations 3 times. No personal response. Every call is a nightmare. Either the rep shut the phone down, or The call is being dropped. I always ask to call me back if the call is being dropped but no one has ever called back. Lufthansa does not take responsibility for the mistake that was done on the company's end. Sometimes the representatives blame us for not booking the cat properly. How on earth I could be responsible for booking the cat only halfway if I'm flying all the way from NYC to Israel. Sometimes they say Israel has changed the animal regulations, which is not true (our animal has already gotten all the permits to enter Israel and none of the Israeli relevant offices confirms this). We have already changed the date of the fight once, in order to try and solve the situation. We told the company we would be willing to do ANYTHING!! to upgrade the ticket, even to buy a third human ticket. Whatever it takes to solve the problem and bring the cats with us. We already missed the Holiday with our family in Israel since the original flight was on Sep the third. All the 3 cats were booked on that flight. We had confirmation for all the 3. We had to pay another month's rent because of Lufthansa. Our apartment is already empty. luckily we didn't remove the bed yet! We weren't supposed to stay in the US anymore. We are highly disappointed with Lufthansa. We have chosen this airline because we thought they would be great with our cats. But the opposite has happened. We call every day and we are already tired, tortured, and devastated. We don't know what to do."|lufthansa
646|"An airline that makes Italian espresso for me while I'm flying is more than OK with me! Five stars for the win!

Lilly coffee from Italy may not be the highest of the high end but oh my gosh, it's better than Folger's or any other American mass-produced coffee swill. Yes, I'm a coffee snob but I know what I like. I like an espresso with a nice crema and a wonderfully complex coffee taste that I can savor and enjoy.

Thanks Lufthansa!"|lufthansa
647|"Totally different experience today here in Frankfurt. Flight was on-time, received an email update with flight status, and the document check was beyond pleasant. The nice young man doing it upgraded the boarding group because of our TSA pre-check status (not that it mattered too much - we had to take a bus to the plane and we didn't have too much in the way of hand luggage).

Boarding was quick and easy. Travelers tip: avoid this airport, if possible, Christmas week. It is beyond busy."|lufthansa
648|"Disaster from beginning to end. Upgraded to premium economy from New York to Sweden at a price of about 500 € for two to get some extra luggage home. Had to pay 100 € extra in N.Y even though i asked the lady at the Lufthansa counter in Frankfurt before we left for the U.S if the premium economy baggage rules applied even though i booked economy from the beginning and upgraded later. She said yes.

1 bag (my wifes. You can imagine the hassle.....) was missing when we landed in N.Y even though we had 2 hours in Frankfurt before take off. Thanks to this we had to go back to Newark the next day loosing about 4 hours of hour christmas holiday, spending money on the taxi to get there and back. We barely had time to get back to the city and change clothes to get to our reservation at Eleven Madison Park wich was almost impossible to get a table at.

For our 500 € upgrade we got a little bit more legroom, the same menu as economy/coach but we get metal utencils instead of plastic.... The service level on the flight home in premium economy was worst then any long haul economy flight i have been on when the stewardess constantly missed asking us if we wanted something to drink etc.

Finally.   I sent a email pretty much with the above info along with the missing bag number and all other info asking for some compansation or refund as i feel cheated. This was 6 weeks ago. The answer?  They have not yet answered.

No more Lufthansa for me in the future."|lufthansa
649|Lufthansa canceled my flight in early March and still has not refunded the ticket, despite my best efforts.  They even lied to the Better Business Bureau to say they'd processed the refund, only to admit later they hadn't.  Under US DOT rules, they must process a refund for a credit card transaction within seven business days.  It has now been 88 days since they canceled, and not only do I not have my money, they won't even provide an estimate of when I might get it, despite freely admitting they owe it.  They're just holding it indefinitely as a kind of involuntary interest-free loan.|lufthansa
650|"I have been flying with Lufthansa  as my only airline for 25 years. Today I was appalled.
My mother and I left from Hannover this am to Frankfurt, to continue our journey to San Diego.
My mother requested and confirmed her wheelchair assistance.
The flight from Hannover was 35 min late but with the proper assistance we could have made our next flight to San Diego. People were stressing so much once we landed, the opened the back door of  the plane and the Stewardesses just hurried everybody off to catch the waiting bus. My mom told her she needed a wheelchair but she said she would help my mom get down the stairs. Again we were rushed towards the bus and again I asked the bus driver for the wheelchair. He told us yes it's at the terminal.
Once everyone got off, we stood there with no one in sight. A Steward saw us phoned for help, again we were left standing until I helped my mom get into the building to get help. Again we had to wait. By now all flights had left. We were stranded at Frankfurt, they checked us into the hotel and told us that the next available flight would be tomorrow same time. No apology no upgrade just an "" oh well"". Tough luck !
I'm so disappointed with Lufthansa. Their attitude today was appalling."|lufthansa
651|"took lufthansa airlines out of yvr to frankfurt...

very clean and spacious economy class. flight attendants well groomed and always smiling and can speak perfect english.

for the 10 hr flight, was served with a welcome beverage of your choice ( wine and Champagne included) , 2 hot towel service, lunch and bfast too, and several rounds of juices and water!

lunch i chose ginger chicken...came with tender pieces of chicken and boiled carrots and soft rice. for airplane food it was above expectations. the chicken was tender and moist. rice was cooked well and carrots were tender. tasted like teriyaki chicken really but i enjoyed it. the bread was stale and cold. one bite i left it. the salad was ordinary but the cake was good . i noticed that the salad and cake were not covered in plastic though....minus 1 start cause of this.

bfast was salsa, scrambled eggs and 3 pcs of bacon!  eggs were ok..made from powdered eggs. bacon was real bacon, although not crispy but still ok for plane fair. again, bread was cold and stale. lol. cane with a yogurt cup which was cold and finished off the meal nice.

for snacks, packaged pretzels of course, and my fav part...kitkat chocolate bars...

inflight entertainment was one of the best...huge touch screen and foldable tray tables, and even a pop out cup holder while the table is secured. lots f movies to choose from, as well as live tv, music, games, tv series, short films etc....i was not bored during the entire 9hr flight. washrooms were kept clean and well maintained!

my only complain, the ac was not that cold. didn't even use the blanket, just the pillow.

take off was a breeze. no turbulence or bumpy experience. landing was perfect too.

would fly again for sure! all things considered...still 4 stars!

cheers!"|lufthansa
652|"Do not flight Lufthansa. They were delayed from Malpensa to Frankfurt so more than 80 passengers miss the flight. We got to the gate and the the airplane was still there but they didn't let us in because the plane was already full. They sold our seats and they acted like it was a normal thing to happen in this Lufthansa. The Lufthansa staff send us to the wrong desk for help. They basically wash their hands, and it was no ones ""Fault"" This airline is about the worst and I had flown in bad airlines before."|lufthansa
653|"On March 10 Lufthansa said they would refund my money for a cancelled flight due to Covid-19. Now, more than 3 weeks later, I still have not received my refund. When I called on April 2, I was told to ""be patient."" I received a refund from United Airlines for the identical flight in only 2 days. Why is Lufthansa delaying?! Why are they hanging onto my money?!"|lufthansa
654|"This flight was my first flight on Lufthansa.  I've been waiting for months to take this flight, as I have decided I couldn't handle the abuse from United Airlines any longer.  With that, and both my eyes looking forward, new adventures and experiences await me.

I took the long way from Los Angeles to Brussels via Vancouver and Munich on July 20th.  The combination of being in seat 1-G, and a newer, A-350-900 with 3 camera views and a GPS guidance tracking was more than I could handle.

BOARDING -

The boarding was great. Business Class receives their own jetway which makes you feel very special, and brought the ""boarding chaos"" to level zero.  Something American carriers have yet to figure out.

SERVICE -

I told my flight attendant that it was my first flight on both the aircraft,and Lufthansa, and I probably shouldn't have done that.  She wanted to give me perfect service, in which the more she tried, the more frustrated she became.  Service was excellent anyways, with only small mistakes that happens to newbies.

QUALITY -

The food and beverage quality were excellent.  By the sounds of the menu, Lufthansa was going to go out of my safe zones in what I like and what I will try.  They reined it in, and though the menus read more complicatedly than they were,  everything was delicious.

The classiest items I noticed were proper salt and pepper dispensers, and butter in a proper butter plate.  Details keeps you in the dream, and one cheap short-cut could ruin it all.  I think Lufthansa did an excellent job, and if the bean-counters try to change things at Lufthansa, Service Mangers, stand your ground.  Anyone can be United, or American.

WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE -

For your intercontinental flights, fresh,heated rolls and cookies through First and Business Class would be a great idea.  The smell would be incredible.

When flying into a particular country, select a brand or two of whiskey or wine from that country.  For example, from Canada, perhaps Crown Royal.  Going to Mexico, you are already bringing Tequila.  I am a whiskey drinker, and I was disappointed that they didn't carry Crown Royal Whiskey from a Canadian/German flight.

This was an EXCELLENT first flight with Lufthansa, and it was a quick 11 hours over Greenland and down into Europe.  The Europeans have made it all very easy.  No need for forms or pens, and there were no exceptionally long lines."|lufthansa
655|"So remember the jokes about reaching the end of the Internet? Well I think I just reached the ""end of yelp"" - apparently it is not available in Saudi Arabia so my plans to light up the city with humorous yelps are thwarted!!!

So let me just review the flight here from Frankfurt. Soooo much better than you get from US airlines - united come on guys - you are simply second rate in comparison. In Business not even First and I get a flatbed for the 5 hour Florida get. The lunch was amazing and fresh (May is asparagus drain in Germany - so fresh asparagus with veal and parsley potatoes was one of the choices. The wines hand picked and everything served with care and real service. Huge TV screen and they supply Bose headphones to enjoy the show! Nice - Lufthansa 5 stars!!!!!"|lufthansa
656|If you have elderly sick parents don't ever book on Lufthansa! My sick elderly 67 year old father is now stuck in Germany and was forced off of a Lufthansa for asking for his rights!  We paid additional money and booked specific seats for him due to his recent open heart and knee surgery,  Lufthansa changed his seat and refused to give him the seat that we PAID for.  Then because he was asking for his seats and complaining they had him humiliated and literally dragged off the plane to the point where his pants came off by 6 police officers.  We are now forced to pay for another flight for him to get back. On top of all that they black listed him from the airline because he was asking for his rights! He is now stuck in Germany for an additional 12+ hours and is undergoing a lot of added stress and anxiety due to what he's been through.

657|I have flown to Europe many times and this first time flying Lufthansa was by far the worst in customer service. Unfriendly and rude are the two words that stand out. Unsmiling and unfriendly stewardess encounters continued in both international and domestic flights.  Wow is all I can say in regards to this experience. Will never choose Lufthansa again.  First time that I had my carry on weighed and forced to put in stored luggage because just over .2 kg. Would not let me remove an item to make it fit.  All I can say is the lasting experience left a bad taste and one I will avoid in the future.|lufthansa
658|"From my one recent experience, there are several positives about flying Lufthansa from Frankfurt to Los Angeles in economy class. The service onboard the plane was very pleasant, and the food was well above average. The first meal - a lunch - was served with metal utensils and was excellent for an airline meal. There was a wide range of movies from which to choose.

I felt the legroom in economy on the Airbus A380-800 was not particularly good. Also, when the person in front of you reclines, there is very little space left between the back of their seat and yourself.

An issue I wish to point out to the airline: our flight was from London Heathrow, connecting at Frankfurt to LAX. To get from the Lufthansa London-Frankfurt flight to the Frankfurt-LAX flight, we had to pass through a first document check station, a full security check, and a second document check station. The distance from the first flight to the second was very long and, although there was a Skytrain, there was a great deal of walking involved.

Unfortunately, one member of our group was detained for what we understand to be random secondary inspection, along with many other travellers. The people selected for secondary inspection were detained for quite a long time and, I'm told, the security personnel were not polite.

Lufthansa had only allowed for about 1 hour between the two flights. This was not enough time, considering the long distance between the two flights, all of the security checkpoints, and the possibility of secondary inspections. Also, the security officials and Lufthansa personnel were not kind with respect to the stress created.

In summary, once on the FRA-LAX flight, the service and food was very good. Legroom and space generally not comfortable in economy. The layout and function of the airport and Lufthansa's tight timeframe to make the connection from London Heathrow, made the transition from the first flight to the connecting flight quite stressful."|lufthansa
659|I used to love Lufthansa back in the day but not anymore.   5 hours late Miami to Frankfurt with hardly any updates and conflicting information.   Then no breakfast served because crew was over their time.       Then.  Frankfurt to Cairo. They load the bus to get to a remote plane and we waited on an overcrowded bus for 45 min.  They told us the plane had a problem so the took us to another plane.   Been 90 minutes now and no restroom very poor air circulation and again no updates.     Problems happen and I don't judge an airline for weather or mechanicals but I do judge them for how they respond.   I will never fly Lufthansa again|lufthansa
660|Lufthansa delayed the refund for a month after we cancelled our flight, even though they promised a 7 day refund. They said it was their staff/system error. When I asked for the waive of cancellation fees, they make me do all kinds of things, including, picture license, bank information ( they won't refund to the credit card for whatever reason), boarding pass ( I sent them the confirmation email , but that was not good enough.), I don't have boarding pass because I cancelled the flight two weeks before the boarding date. Then they want selfies with drivers license. Now 1 1/2 months later, I got an e mail today asking me exactly the same thing they asked in the first email . I will never use this company again.|lufthansa
661|The best airline on the planet! You won't believe all the leg room in coach, plus their wine is delicious.|lufthansa
662|"Everything was pretty good except the lady at the baggage check in, in Frankfurt. She talked down to me. She is not a happy person and should consider getting another job.  How can I possibly see a small digital scale embedded on the counter unless it is pointed out to me?  Do you really need to yell at me and treat me like an idiot because I didn't see it?  Anyway, I hope things go better for her so she can be a happy person. Being angry at everyone all day can't possibly be good for your health.  

People never forget how you made them feel. Hence, the 3 stars.

People at baggage check in were confused and told me to go upstairs. They guy up there said line was too long and to go back downstairs. They should use walkie-talkies.

Food on plane was great.  Flight attendants were awesome."|lufthansa
663|"I am a frequent flyer with American and United Airlines and travel every week within US and occasionally in international routes. I have flown in quite a few major airlines in the world in first, business and economy class. This is my first time flying Lufthansa business because of its star alliance partnership with United. I must acknowledge that I had one of the best experience flying from DFW to FRA to DXB. The cabin crew in both segments were extremely friendly and accommodating of all requests in a very polite manner. It was nice of the parser to come and introduce herself as soon as we boarded at DFW. The flight attendants were always alert and asking if I needed anything before I asked and very prompt in responding to call button. Food and beverage selections were of high quality and nice to see that Lufthansa selects the menu items keeping dietary restrictions for all cultures and religions, there's something for everyone in the short menu.

The business class flat seats were comfortable for me. However, someone taller and heavier than me may have a bit issue stretching.

Overall, my experience with Lufthansa and its cabin crew was extremely enjoyable and it will be at the top my of list in my future international travel from US to wherever Lufthansa flies.

#Airwolf"|lufthansa
664|The experience on Lufthansa was a little mixed. The staff except for one flight attendant was terrific, pleasant and accommodating. There are some things that Americans should know - in economy class the areas under the seats are very small and will not fit a regular sized backpack without encroaching on your leg room. Economy is very cramped for a long flight. A purse or small backpack will be fine. The in flight entertainment is generous and headphones are provided along with pillows and blankets for overnight flights. The food is pretty good but there is not a choice in a menu card in the seat back. The staff will give you a choice IF there is one. Very efficient boarding.|lufthansa
665|"Lost Luggage, TERRRIBLE Customer serice
#1, they insisted on taking our suitcases at the gate because the plane was full. Keep in mind this was a direct flight from Frankfurt to Paris. We get to Charles De Gaulle and wait and wait... 1 hour later one of their employees approaches us and tells us our luggage is in Frankfurt. We spend another hour filling out paper work and are promised that our luggage will arrive that evening and be delivered to our apartment This never happens, and we receive no calls or emails about the status of our luggage. It is FREEZING in Paris and we have no sweaters, or the appropriate shoes. We spend hours on the phone with the worst customer service department in Germany, whose employees clearly did not care. They wouldn't even tell us where our luggage was. Two days later it was delivered. Horrible experience. Will never fly them again and I warn you - that they lost the luggage of at least 12 people on that flight."|lufthansa
666|"My review, continued...

The dinner choices were pasta and chicken, and they couldn't confirm if they had a specific ingredient in the pasta.  (You'd think that they would have an ingredient list!)  Not wanting to risk eating the pasta without knowing if that ingredient was in it, I decided on the chicken.  Not only did I not have a choice, but the person beside me ordered the chicken, which came with rice, and it looked pretty tasty.  However, the dish I got was not what my neighbour had, and I'm not even certain it was chicken.  It was some mystery meat (probably pork) with BBQ sauce (I hate BBQ sauce, and the chicken my neighbour had did not have that sauce on it), and instead of rice, it was some nasty mush (quinoa?).  Also, the salad came with feta cheese all over it, something that makes me extremely ill (my neighbour's salad was different, of course, and did not have feta cheese).  I swear, they somehow knew that I don't eat pork, BBQ sauce, and goat cheese--I'm surprised there weren't bananas in the dish.

When I asked the flight attendant why I had not gotten the same dish as my neighbour, they it was because they ran out.  First of all, if you run out of something, tell the person, so they can decide weather or not to go with the alternative.  Second, if there were only two choices, as claimed, WTF was this third meal?  But the worst part is, the flight attendant who took my order outright LIED to me, because when I asked if I would be getting the same dish as my neighbour, he said YES.  I asked another flight attendant about why I had gotten a completely different meal than my neighbour when I was ordering the same dish, and they said some bullshit about how I got ""regular economy class chicken"", not ""premium economy class chicken.""  I don't know if I quite believe it, but at least it's an explanation, whether true or not.  

So no dinner for me, but I had some snacks that kept me satisfied enough (ie. I did not get hypoglycemic.)  Not that I could have eaten dinner anyway, as the asshole in front of me would not move his seat up during dinner time (he was fully reclined).  I asked a flight attendant to ask the guy to move his seat up (this is when I thought I was going to be able to eat dinner), and they said that they don't ask people to move their seats up, in case people want to sleep.  On every single flight I have ever been on, during meal time, flight attendants ask everyone to move their seat up as a courtesy for those trying to eat, and I have seen flight attendants wake people up to do so.  I was not impressed.  And because the guy in front of me would not move his seat up, I spilled water all over my jeans, and had to spend the next seven hours with wet jeans (thank goodness it wasn't wine).

About halfway through the flight, I felt something on my elbow, which I had resting on my arm rest (I was in an aisle seat).  It was the asshole behind me who thought it was perfectly appropriate and acceptable behaviour to place his feet up on my arm rest.  I pushed his filthy feet off my arm, and thankfully he got the hint and did not dare place his feet on my arm rest again.  

Then breakfast time rolled around.  The asshole in front of me once again had his seat reclined all the way back, and this time I demanded that the flight attendant make him move it up (during dinner time, because the flight attendant refused to ask him, I had to tell him to move his seat).  I could tell they weren't too happy about my request.  For breakfast they were serving omelettes, and because I don't eat pork, I asked if the omelette was vegetarian, and the flight attendant said YES.  So imagine my surprise and disgust when I bite into my omelette, only to discover SAUSAGE in it.  WTF.  I asked a direct question, and the flight attendant outright LIED to me.  And when I told him there was sausage in it, I could tell by his reaction that he knew he had lied.

Lufthansa, to my surprise, offers unlimited free alcohol, which is always a bonus in my books because I like to drink.  (I have never been on a flight that offers free alcohol, so this was a novelty for me.)  But despite the fact that you can get free booze on Lufthansa, they still get one star.  Also, despite having four glasses of wine on a practically empty stomach, I did not feel tipsy at all.  

I was dreading the flight home, but to my surprise, it was fine.  The staff were actually really nice and did not lie to me about anything, and I could actually eat the food, which was quite tasty.  No complaints about the flight home.  But despite the pleasant flight home, the first flight was so horrific that they get one star."|lufthansa
667|"This was my first time flying with Lufthansa, and ugh, what a horrible experience.  Right from the get go there were problems, and the staff were rude and unhelpful.

I booked my flight to Prague through a travel agent, flying from Vancouver to Frankfurt, then onto Prague.  The itinerary with my flight details indicated I was flying Air Canada, flight # [xyz].  However, it turned out that I was flying Lufthansa flight # [abc], because Air Canada had purchased the seat from Lufthansa, or something or other that really doesn't matter.  The point is, I thought I was flying Air Canada, yet I was actually flying Lufthansa, something I did not realize until I got the YVR.  The reason why this was significant was because when I tried to check-in at the airport using the self check-in machine (there is no customer service these days at airports, it seems), it wouldn't work, since my Air Canada flight technically did not exist.  I then saw on the departures board that there was a flight to FRA with Lufthansa leaving at the same time as my flight.  

Wanting to confirm that it was my fight, I went to the employee at the Lufthansa counter, who was doing fuck all, for some assistance.  But he refused to listen to my question, cutting me off as I was trying to explain my predicament, and told me to check-in at the self check-in machine.  Frustrated, I went to an Air Canada employee, and the very nice employee helped me out, explaining that I was indeed flying with Lufthansa, and told me that if I were unsure of my flight number, I could check-in by scanning my passport, information that the Lufthansa employee could easily have told me, had he been bothered to listen to my question.

On the plane, my movie screen, a touch screen (which also controlled the overhead light), would not work.  Not realizing that I was not the only one with the problem (as the people beside me and other people near me all had working screens), I told a flight attendant about the issue, and they seemed rather irritated with me.  It turned out that there was some glitch and quite a few screens were malfunctioning, so they did a re-set of their computer system to get them working.  Not having my screen work right away wasn't an issue, but they way they spoke to me and handled the situation was unpleasant.

However, a rude airport employee and rude flight attendant are minor issues compared to what came next.  But due to Yelp's limit on length, my review is too long, so stay tuned for the rest of my review, posted as an ""update""...."|lufthansa
668|I had a round-trip flight from Tel Aviv - Frankfurt and really had no complaints. I flew the normal economy seating. I was served an ok breakfast to Frankfurt. The dinner meal back to TLV was better. Free alcohol is a plus!  The crew was great both ways. We had a slight delay out of Frankfurt (weather) and the pilots were very apologetic, even if it was out of their control.  I would definitely fly with Lufthansa again in the future.|lufthansa
669|"Here's one bit of helpful travel advice: When flying to Europe and coming back to the USA, try to avoid using an American Carrier. That's assuming that you're traveling on a Legacy airline and not one of the discount carriers.

Gayle and I recently ended a wonderful 2-Week Holiday in Spain and used Lufthansa on both the SFO to Frankfurt and FRA to Madrid legs. We were also on Lufthansa from Barcelona to Frankfurt, but then ended up on United for the final leg home. Here were some key comparisons between the respective intercontinental German and US flights (Economy Class):

We also compared our Portugal travel experience last year (2010) and found our impressions to be fairly consistent. For example, our Coach seat on Portugal's TAP Airlines (coming back from Lisbon) was in many ways a nicer experience than flying Business Class from Philadelphia to Lisbon on US Air.

Gayle and I also found the Europe-based Lufthansa flights offered good service, decent food and beverages, and an otherwise comfortable experience. At the same time, we're not huge fans of the Frankfurt Airport, of which walks can be long, signage can be confusing, and getting help can sometimes be ""endearing"". I hear that Munich may be a better German Airport to connect through....."|lufthansa
670|"This was our first time traveling with Lufthansa Airlines, departing from Madrid Spain to Munich Germany. It happened to be the same day that the airline pilots decided to go on strike. Good thing we were on the last flight out from Madrid to Munich Germany before the strike started.

Our flight was delayed departing from Madrid, but we actually arrived on time to Munich Germany (thank goodness for tail winds!)

What warrants a 5-star rating for Lufthansa was -- my husband and I had a connecting international flight from Munich to Toronto Canada (within 40 min of our arrival to Munich). Every minute was precious or else we would completely miss the only flight out of Munich to Toronto!

Immediately after we got out of the plane in Munich, there was a Lufthansa agent waiting for the passengers that needed to get onto the connecting Toronto flight! There were 6 of us total & he escorted us through the huge airport to the customs line.
He even got us to the front of the customs line since our international flight was about to depart! We quickly went through customs and the agent continued to escort us to the Air Canada flight to Toronto!

We had only 15 min to spare to get our boarding pass from the agent at the counter & then board the plane! The 6 of us were pretty much the last ones to board this transatlantic flight!

Phew!! What a relief to make this flight on time, we give credit to the organization & efficiency of Lufthansa for making this happen! :) glad they had that agent waiting for us once we arrived in Munich.

There was no way that we would've been able to locate the customs area and then get to our next gate if we had to do it all on our own!

Note: we really liked the thin seats on our Lufthansa flight, I've never seen such thin seats before on any USA based flights.
Also our flight was only two hours from Madrid to Munich, yet they still served a meal, incredible. I've never heard of that before?

The reason we would give it 4 stars out of 5 is that this airline went on strike 4 times already in a span of 1 year, isn't that enough already?! :) other than that, they are great."|lufthansa

672|"We booked flights from Amsterdam to Rome and Rome to Paris.  Both flights had a layover in Frankfurt.  The flight to Rome was okay and on time, however my brand new hard case luggage was substantially damaged.  The service center told me that I would have to file a claim online. I was okay with that. The flight from Rome to Paris was delayed because it arrived late to Rome. We missed Our connecting flight from Frankfurt to Paris because of the delay.  The airline told us we were re-booked on a 2 pm flight.  Not happy about the two hour delay, but could be worse.  

Now, as I literally sit on the floor of the Lufthansa Service Center writing  this review, we are waiting for our boarding passes (denied access to the roped-off seating area because the guy believed he already helped us).  Ha Ha!! were just told that we have been booked on the 4:45 pm flight! To top it off, all three of our seats are middle seats, in different rows. None of our seats are together.  I pre-paid for a car service to take us from airport to hotel. Was told they are not going to wait five hours for us to arrive and I am out the money. And of course....  I was told that any complaints with Lufthansa must be filed online.

I travel internationally twice a year. First and last time on this airline. This has been the worst experience I have had with an airline. No sense of customer service. I find myself wondering where our luggage will end up. SMH"|lufthansa
673|I was traveling from Washington DC to Frankfurt. Our first flight from Atlanta (by a different airline which I will not mention) was messed up. However there was a supervisor, her name is Marva (5/31/17 Gate B45 4pm) (may be misspelling her name) she was wonderful courteous and on top of it. She knew exactly what she was doing and was being pulled back and forth every other second but she maintained her composure and was professional at all times. Not only were we upgraded for something that was not their fault treated very kindly. I would like for her to be recognized for her great job.|lufthansa
674|"In an era where it feels like airlines are cutting corners everywhere they possibly can it is refreshing to fly Lufthansa, a company which still values their customers.  I've flown with them numerous times over the years in continental Europe and there is a reason why I keep coming back to them.  

The flight attendants are always welcoming and attentive.  They always speak to you with a smile and in general treat you pretty well.  I have to say that passenger agents though are not as good.  It's not that they're rude or anything it's just that they don't seem to be at the same level as the cabin crew.  

Even on short-haul flights you can expect to be taken care of.  They always feed you (for free no less).  As some of you may know free food is not always the norm on some airlines.  On overseas flights they are very attentive even if you're in economy class.  You'll be well fed and the flight attendants pass through the cabin frequently with drinks.  The entertainment systems are better on other airlines but everything else is pretty good.  Best yet is that you get legroom!  I'm pretty tall and have taken many flights where my knees were touching the seat so I always appreciate legroom.

Lufthansa is flying done right and I wish other airlines would take note and do the same.  I have to say that after my most recent trip with them I arrived at my destinations tired but in a good mood because I really enjoyed my flights.  They really go out of their way to make sure that you the customer are taken care of."|lufthansa

677|"I have always heard good things about Lufthansa. Is it true? Indeed YES! Maybe just a little above normal service from other airlines. It doesn't bother me that much but when the person sitting in front of you puts their seat back and you're watching television, their seat comes forward and it is slightly annoying. You can't really tell the other person to not do it because it is part of the comfort zone to sleep in that manner. I have read fights during flights have occurred because of this reason. Everyone on board has the right to do it. On a Lufthansa flight I thought this was less intrusive/annoying.

I've flown about a dozen airlines to know the tiny differences. I know every flight is different so I'll speak only for a normal flight with no issues. Boarding is on time and landing was smooth. The pilots I can understand when they make announcement. The stewardesses are pleasant. Most airlines have pleasant stewardesses anyway. In terms of food, I like the spread. If I had to compare to what I normally fly: Delta, I'd say Lufthansa is three times better in my opinion.

However, Lufthansa could improve on their movie selection. But with the slightly improvement in comfortability that can slide, even the bathrooms were better."|lufthansa
678|Lufthansa gate agent was amazing. Quickly figured out the crazy itinerary resulting from an air Canada cancelled flight (followed by 3 rebookings). The Lufthansa people quickly found the optimal way to get me to Budapest. Great work.|lufthansa
679|I was on a short flight from Frankfurt to Nice on Lufthansa.  Although it was only a 1 1/2 hour flight, the two flight attendants served everyone a yogurt drink & a packet of fresh apple slices then came by with a drink cart including complementary bottled wine!  Pretty darn good for an economy class hopper flight. See a few pictures.|lufthansa
680|"Long-Haul Flights: 3 stars
Short-Haul Flights: 4 stars

I recently did Singapore-Frankfurt-Prague with Lufthansa, and it was good overall. I was in a new Airbus A380 for the long haul, and to be honest I didn't like it that much. There weren't any foot rests and I felt like the rows were a bit too close together; when all the seats are reclined back and you are sitting in the window seat, it's definitely a struggle to get out to the aisle! Their in-flight entertainment system has a good selection of TV shows, movies, and music, but I don't think it's very user friendly. It may seem all high tech with a touch screen, but it's not very responsive and lags a lot. On my way to Frankfurt, mine didn't even work! Going back to Singapore, it was lagging, and still cumbersome to navigate. However, they did offer live World Cup coverage, so that spares them from further criticism.

The food was just okay. For dinner, they had 2 choices, for breakfast, only one choice. If I recall correctly, SQ has 3 choices for dinner, and maybe 2-3 for breakfast.

Believe it or not, I thought the snacks they served on the short-haul flight were better. What I thought would be a dry croissant for breakfast turned out to be my all-time favourite CHOCOLATE CROISSANT! I was all, OOH GIRL, YOU KNOW ME SO WELL! And coming back from Prague, we were given a chicken with black bean sauce wrap; surprisingly juicy and well seasoned.

I didn't encounter any issues with the check-in staff or the flight attendants. We also had a tight connection in Frankfurt for our flight going back to SG and were worried that our luggage wouldn't make it, but luckily it did! Kudos to the luggage guys at Frankfurt!

Given my in-flight experience on their long-haul, Lufthansa wouldn't be my first choice when traveling to Europe from Asia, but for short-hauls within Europe, I wouldn't mind at all."|lufthansa
681|This is my favorite airport in the world.  And Lufthansa is by far the most helpful & professional of airlines!  Our flight from Rome was delayed so we cannot get back to USA til tomorrow, & they put us into the Sheraton in the airport.  This is so civilized!  The poor customer service rep was overwhelmed by the almost 100 passengers who did not make their connections yet she was kind, patient, professional.  This is how airlines should be run!  Thank you, Lufthansa!|lufthansa
682|We used Lufthansa from Frankfurt to Orlando round trip and it had to be the worst or should I say Wurst flights every! We will never fly with this airline again and will tell our customers that Delta would be a much better option. Horrible check in procedures, bad food. hard seats, less leg room that most airlines, and a very dirty plane.|lufthansa
683|"I am extremely disappointed with Lufthansa and their arrogant attitude. I was flying with my boyfriend for a 9 hours flight and we wanted to sit together. However, without telling anything to me I got rebooked last minute to an empty premium economy seat while my boyfriend was in the economy seat. Since next to my new seat there was not anybody, after the boarding was completed I asked my boyfriend to move up. The hostess saw him and started shouting to him that he had to pay 300$ to sit there making him look as somebody that was stealing!!! I tried to explain the situation but she didn't want to hear. It was extremely embarrassing!

So, I decided to move back to the seat I was originally assigned in economy. While I was moving there, another hostess was moving for FREE an entire family from economy to economy premium because they couldn't be seated together...

I moved back to the seat that I was originally assigned in economy to have a 9 hours flight together with my boyfriend and the screen was broken and the seat didn't move... Seriously?!!?!?

It was the worst humiliating experience ever. I understand that rules are rules but I honestly think that rules should apply 1) for everybody and 2) with common sense. In this situation Lufthansa didn't have either of them. I am frequent traveler, I spend lots of money on trips and definitely this was my last trip with Lufthansa."|lufthansa
684|I have had good experiences from Lufthansa arriving/leaving out of Dulles Airport.  All of my experiences weren't 5 star but I didn't come back complaining about something that went wrong.  This time I got tickets through United and well I didn't mind flying either United or Lufthansa but because the service is generally better on European/Asian airlines I chose Lufthansa.  The plane was a newer/bigger plane and I'm not entirely fond of the 3-4-3 configuration but the seats were comfortable.  Economy plus gets you a long way for those that don't like to push extra money.  Our flight was smooth and we arrived on time the staff/flight attendants were helpful and friendly.  The food was tolerable - not that great but I didn't get sick and there were good amount of options for things to drink, less for wine.  Overall I've enjoyed my flights with Lufthansa.|lufthansa
685|I checked in my parents in defined seats. When we arrived at the airport suddenly they were not checked in and they did not have there seats together. I showed the lady the check in information but she did not care and gave us attitude. She even planed me for the screw up. Of course now they could not sit together for the 9 hour flight. Shitty attitude and bad service     Fly delta. They are friendly and at least they try to help you.|lufthansa
686|Lufthansa is deceptive in its communications on re-booking ticket fees.  The change fee is understandable.  But the price charged for a re-booked ticket is significantly higher than the price of a new ticket,  in fact the re-book pricing + change fee are MORE than the charge for a new ticket.  They would not resolve my issue on the phone despite a 3 hour phone call.  Be careful with Lufthansa on the issue of needing to change flights.|lufthansa
687|"Lufthansa is by far the worst airline ever.  I solely fly them from California to Frankfurt ONLY because of their internet feature.  If another airline gets an internet feature to fly from either California or Boston to Frankfurt, I will immediately change all future travel plans.

Complaint 1:
This airline rips you off.  For example, I have flown back and forth to Germany nine times this year.  Everytime I purchase a ticket, I add my miles and more number.  Hoewver, EVERY time I get to the airport, the rewards number is simply not there and i'm told that it's SIMPLE to add the miles after the flight.  I'm told that ALL I have to do is keep my ticket and I can just fill out a form and voila, it works.  

This is a blantant lie.  If you are told this lie, do not leave the counter.  

Adding points retroactively is nearly impossible.  First, you have to fill out a form online, this form asks for twelve fields such as booking class (economy A, B, C, D, E F, G, etc), ticket number beginning with 220, date and time of flight, gate number etc.  
Unlike the representative said, it is not possible to find all of these things on your boarding pass.

In that case, Lufthansa forces you to pay 20 euros to get the information that you don't have.  Simply calling them won't help you.  They say that they can't access it and it's a different apartment.  The form asks you to wait up to a month to hear back from them.   And, don't let me forget to mention that you have to do all of this within six months.

Complaint 2:
Everytime I fly, something doesn't work.  Whether my T.V., my seatback (on a seat where it is suppose to) or they forget my gluten free meal so I end up not being able to eat very much.  
During the flight, I never want to be rude or cause too much havoc, as I won't die without a t.v. or without my seat leaning back. However, I do feel that after multiple occasions, if nothing else, I should at least be able to file a formal complaint.

No can do.

Complaint 3:

I have written a letter and called three different offices ranging form their south africa office to their German office and various emails from both the lufthansa.de and the lufthansa.com websites.  Their response? You've written the wrong dept, please call customer service."|lufthansa
688|"Lufthansa, Your outstanding service did it again!

Lufthansa, you are the best airline in the world. You treat your customers very well. Your flight attendants are the best and so sweet and caring. There is hardly a time where they don't have a smile! I have never had a bad flight with this airline. Business class on the 747-400 ( retrofitted) and the 747-8i has to be the best. or one of the best. This is my favourite airline after SWISS. I'll have to write about them next. The food is good ( a bit heavy ) but still it is delicious. Whenever i get a chance. I'd fly with them again. But they do need to lower their prices because i know Business class is 2,000 dollars pp. usually. Expensive! Hey, it's worth the price.
Vielen dank Lufthansa für deine freundlich Flugbegleiter und tolles Service.

Thanks Lufthansa

690|Generally efficient operation. They handle self absorbed passengers well and seem to be well trained. Boarding area very clean. I would only recommend they work on their boarding control better. Huge mob seems to stay balled up even after the staff clearly state what numbers should be boarding.|lufthansa
691|"I have flown on Lufthansa several times.  They connect many U.S. and Canadian cities to 2 German hubs, and connections to Southern European airports are excellent.

Lufthansa is a veritable compendium of positives and negatives.  The positives are that they are punctual and their flight crew, based on announcements coming from the cockpit, seem very professional and one feels they are in competent hands.  That cannot be discounted.  I prefer to deal with Lufthansa reservations on this side of the pond, in the U.S., because you get the efficiency of a German outfit buffered by better American customer service. Compared to some more relaxed European carriers (Alitalia and TAP Portugal), the customer service counters at FRA and MUC are exacting.  They have all the answers, but someone needs to tell some of their employees to check their hemorrhoid issues at the door upon coming to work.

The negative is the in-cabin flight service.  They can be too stern for my taste.  If you choose to be a flight attendant, try to do a good job of pretending to like your job, and smile.  They have some great alternatives to be able to cross the pond if your preferred routes are booked solid - MUC to SFO, FRA to Toronto, and FRA to Vancouver, from which you can then finish your journey on United or Air Canada.  I will never forget flying LH from Frankfurt to Toronto one summer, returning to the States through Canada.  About an hour after take-off, the big 747 was bouncing around like a bath tub toy after passing Ireland and while over the Irish Sea, just as meal service had commenced. One matronly flight attendant was walking through the larger rear cabin of the jumbo, shouting:  ""Everybody seet down.  Fasten your seat belts.  Vee cannot serve now.  It ees too dangerous.""  All right, already.  We get it.

Truthfully, dealing with the Germanic Lufthansa is often a double-edged sword.  You get punctuality and efficiency.  You also get stoicism with a dose of attitude thrown in.  They could include charm school in training their employees who have contact with the public.  I only fly Lufthansa when I have a free multi-airline Star Alliance ticket and can select from various carriers.  I prefer not to fork over my own money to travel on them. However, I do applaud them for being the launch customer for Boeing's latest and greatest - the majestic Boeing 747 8-i."|lufthansa
692|I made horrible continental as well as intercontinental flight experiences with Lufthansa. The flight to Zurich was to bear but the long one to Tokyo was dreadful! The airplane was old and TV monitors on top were in bad quality remembering 70s era. Additionally there was no space for legs because of bad seat pitch and that was very painful! Food quality was just bad. Given blankets were old and also made my black trousers appearing dirty!! I complained to cabin crew but they didn't have a dust cleaning roller! Since then I don't fly with Lufthansa anymore!|lufthansa
693|"Good airline friendly staff. My only complaint is there excess baggage charges for carryons and that fact that some of their long haul flights do not have tvs in every seat.
They feed you well and serve alcohol throughout the flight. My BOS-FRA flight was on time as was my regional flight."|lufthansa
694|"Lufthansa's online reservation service has a feature which allows you to hold a ticket price for 48 hours.  I reserved a flight and, mistakenly thinking later that I had completed the purchase, I did not act on it further.  Exactly 48 hours after making the reservation, I received an email cheerfully notifying me that Lufthansa had cancelled me and I had lost €30 by forfeiture, according to contract.  I called the customer service number and asked to be transferred to a supervisor.  I gave my reservation code: 8PGPYM.  He gave me his ID: DCSB (David).  I asked him why I had not received a reminder email to complete the purchase within 48 hours, before cancellation and forfeiture of €30.  He said that a reminder email had been sent an hour earlier. (I knew this to be false, so it made me more curious.)  I asked if he could please re-send that same reminder e-mail, as I had not received it.  He said ""no,"" and added that it would not be worth my time and money to take legal action against Lufthansa to prove whether such an email had been sent or not.  Essentially, he was admitting that he had lied earlier about the reminder email being sent.  My question to Lufthansa is: how do you want to treat customers?  What happened to me will happen to anyone who forgets to complete the purchase within 48 hours, you DO NOT send reminder emails (I know this from my experience and talking to others), and you will become famous as the airline which cleverly pickpockets its passengers.  Is that really the reputation you want?"|lufthansa
695|On arrival in Frankfurt I asked to change my seat on the return flight.  I had already paid a fee for a pre-assigned seat and the Lufthansa agent told me I had to pay again because it was paid to a travel agency. I know that the travel agency remits the fee to Lufthansa as required when the ticket is issued so it is never necessary to pay the fee twice. The agent refused to change the seat. On my return flight I encountered an extremely rude and nasty flight attendant. Lufthansa certainly needs to understand the value of good customer service.|lufthansa
696|Terrible customer service and very unhelpful. We checked in and got seats a week ago and confirmed two aisle seats on our flight from Frankfurt to Boston. Confirmed again two aisle seats this morning in Athens that when we got on our flight in Frankfurt we would have two aisle seats across from eachother. When we got to the gate suddenly we have two middle seats after confirming on two different occasions that we will have two aisle seats and then there is nothing they can do.  With this airline, the customer is not important all they want is your money.|lufthansa
697|Terrible, terrible - do not fly lufthansa.  They have the worst customer service at the desk in the airport and do not accommodate you even if you have a dire need to sit in a window or roomy seat.  I'm traveling today on an emergency and I had already paid an additional $1,050 to travel on an emergency and I tried to explain to the lady at the gate counter - in vain. She would not understand or try to help me. I have terrible foot edema in one foot and it is really uncomfortable when I travel.  Every other airline accommodated me except for Lufthansa.  It was a mean and cold experience.  I am never flying this airline again.  TERRIBLE|lufthansa
698|"Usually Lufthansa is a safe bet for a relatively easy flight. I've had varying experiences with their aircrafts flying to and from the US to Germany, usually into Frankfurt or Munich. However, our recent trip to and from Split Croatia, from Nuremberg, with stops in Frankfurt am main, were ridiculously convoluted and stressful thanks to these ladies and gentlemen.

Weather happens--I get it. When lightning storms encircled Frankfurt and Nuremberg this past Sunday, flights experienced some serious delays. However, we were told (along with plenty others with connecting flights) onboard our Lufthansa flight from Split to Frankfurt, that there was a 'good chance'; our connecting flight would be delayed for take-off as well, and that we might not all be stranded.

We arrive--FINALLY--and are told our flight took off. The security guards pushed us through security again anyways because the airport was closing and they told us to go to the terminal A lufthansa service center. After going through that, plus passport control AGAIN, a rather irate (by any standards) man 'greeted' us at the service center. He checked our flight and didn't BELIEVE that we just flew Lufthansa from Croatia. I'm not one to take kindly to being treated like a moron. It wasn't until we forcibly suggested he re-read our Lufthansa issued boarding passes for the preceding, and connecting, flights that he seemed to halfheartedly accept that yes, service was in fact required. Then, he did not bother to check on our connecting flight, and let us get in line for service. When our number was called and the agent began to investigate, after several minutes mind you, she called another gate agent who informed her that the flight in question was STILL boarding for just a few more precious minutes, and had been delayed, as originally predicted and never confirmed. COOL.

I don't know if you've ever had the distinct pleasure of making it to your gate at Frankfurt am Main, but getting to your flight in our circumstances is a sprinters'-only-club. Thankfully, we're runners. The gate agent in question literally yelled RUN. NOW. to us, which can only enhance the image of desperation this picture paints.

Long story short, Lufthansa had a 'failure' to 'communicate' within its own organization, and we are exhausted."|lufthansa
699|"There have been changes that have made Ryanair more acceptable over the years.  Ryanair is much better for the seasoned traveler who knows what can go south than for someone who is traveling abroad for the first or second time and is not familiar with their quirks and ""nickel and dime"" traps, the latter of which are mostly avoidable.

First, Ryanair's previously cluttered and tacky website has now been streamlined to be more visually appealing and easier to use.  Navigating it goes more smoothly.

Second, Ryanair's overhead bins previously cluttered by a lot of advertising have been cleaned up  It's a relief to see a lot more hard plastic on their surfaces, just like you'd see on most other airlines.

Third, Ryanair doesn't perform too poorly when it comes to sticking to their schedule.  I haven't seen much in the way of late flights on them and, if the flight got out late, they are able to recoup most of the time in the air.  Similarly, they seem to perform okay as far as getting your baggage to and from your destination.  In short, their operations seem to have gotten past more and more teething problems as time has marched on.  Additional improvement has come in the way of allowing passengers to connect on some itineraries.  I notice that they'll only allow someone to do this if their flights go through a major ""hub"" (which they technically do not have) and there is plenty of slack in the connecting time.  I have seen that, if there are 3 or more hours, they'll allow connecting to get someone from the Iberian peninsula to Italy, for example, and vice-versa.

Fourth, Ryanair does have some ball busting last minute prices if you didn't print a boarding pass, didn't figure on bringing a bag until the morning of departure, or your luggage goes over their strict limits in terms of size and weight.  Some of these can be circumvented by knowing exactly what you need to do (by reading the fine print) and picking among the tiers of pricing they offer, and the allowances that come with those tiers.  Let's face it.  Those last minute price gouges, charging you for anything and everything on board, and the stupid duty free carts in the aisles are some of the ways they can make up for loss leader pricing.

By working within their framework, I have been able to fly on them cheaply and effectively on point to point itineraries within Europe.  I, too, would dread a cancelled Ryanair flight.  One thing I have done is to fly on them on a segment that operates daily and for which there are ideally multiple flights during the day.  A local (meaning a EU type) might not have to exercise that much caution.  A foreigner from overseas can't afford that scenario ... and they don't seem to exchange courtesies with other airlines when their passengers are in a bind, just like Southwest in the U.S. does its own thing.  Also, by all means, get to the airport early for a Ryanair flight and have all your planning t's crossed and i's dotted.  Then, you should be good to go."|ryanair
700|"I already knew what I was giving them, in terms of stars, and this is, if anything, a little generous.

Ryanair is a large low-cost airline, one of a few apparently viable ones in Europe, and their chief attribute is being able to fly within Europe from point to point, oftentimes between less stomped on places, and avoid having to change planes at a hub airport.  Truth be told, if those airlines which required a change of planes offered low prices and great 1-way fares, I'd go with the other airlines.  Also, Ryanair flights are all booked as point to point, meaning they are organized around a 1-way fare structure.

Like I said, their cheap flights will connect places I like visiting, enabling me to fly from Porto PT to Pisa (essentially their surrogate for Florence).  And, if you book the segment early, it's downright cheap, though the fare will require the socialistic bump-up in fees and taxes seen in Europe.

The negatives are numerous.  First, how do you plan to manage a vacation with a roll-aboard that, if you wanted to bring it in, weighs 10 kilos (or 22 pounds)?  That includes the self-weight of the luggage.  You have to check it, and do so for an additional cost  through their website BEFORE you fly.  I had a friend who thought they'd be lenient for 5 to10 extra pounds (2.2 to 4.5 kilos), and the cost of checking that bag at ""airport prices"" cost more than the price of the ticket.  Now, they also want you to print your boarding pass BEFORE getting to the airport, or there's a nice up-charge for that, too.  So, here I am, in this great hotel in Porto PT (damn, we need a category for that country) and I tried to print the boarding pass at the guest computer and printer near the front desk.  Something was not configured correctly, and they let me into the back office to print it there.  Whew.  About 20 minutes of wasted time.  Not only that, their website is cluttered and an eyesore.

Then, let's get to the actual flying experience.  Like our home grown Southwest, they exclusively use B 737s.  That's good.  Their spacing of seats, which don't appear to recline, is not.  The sides of the overheads are, or have been, sullied by all their advertising and one feels more like they are on a subway.  The cabin service is not that friendly, either.  I don't remember if they'll give you a cup of water or make you pay for a bottle.  Fortunately, most of their flights are in the 2 to 2.5 hour range.  

Then, let's get to their general convenience.  Like my cousin says ""they fly at odd hours.""  They have a lot of flights that leave at 6:35 am or at 10:55 pm.  So, where are they in the middle of the day?  The Irish aren't known for taking siestas.  Maybe I shouldn't push this!  They also fly with weird operating frequencies, like a Monday and a Friday, so vacation planning takes some gymnastics. If flying into a large metro area, they almost never use the main airport (it's Ciampino for Rome, Bergamo - an altogether different city - for Milan, and other minor airports for Frankfurt, Barcelona, and Paris) so they can get better fees for gates while these airports require that you find less convenient transportation options to get you to and from there.

In the end, what makes Ryanair a workable situation is the availability of flights like Porto-Pisa and other city pairings like that, and at a low price if you book early and avoid their obnoxious fees by being vigilant.  And, since it's cheaper, there will be characters on board.  This group of girls from Portugal must have decided to vacation in Italy, and were on a Bergamo flight, and were also on the 45 minute shuttle bus into Milan.  They were goofing around, making fun of Italian billboards, applying makeup to each other, and going bonkers when we went through a toll station, exclaiming ""Portagem, portagem!"" and taking pictures of it when they in fact have highway toll stations in Portugal.  Having them on board the flight and on the bus sort of made me chuckle after being pissed off from the Ryanair flight.  Of the other low cost carriers in Europe, Germany's Air Berlin and Spain's Veuling are better from what I've experienced."|ryanair
701|"Ryanair is a fraud. I booked a flight to Brussels and while I was there I was charged for a flight back to Dublin by Ryanair that WASN""T authorized by me or my credit card. I called Ryanair and they stated that they had made the charge and couldn't refund me. These guys are horrible."|ryanair
702|"We took this flight from Pisa to Brussels. The thing with budget airlines is they can cancel the flight anytime giving some lame excuse and if not, then you are lucky to board the flight. If all goes well, these are best, because you paid nothing to compare to what we pay here in the USA. Even for budget airlines (spirit and others), we pay $200-300 for 2-3 hours flight. So Europe folks, chill. You are not facing the mountain.

The flight was on time, boarded on time and we did not face any issue, because we have already researched about where we have to pay apart from the ticket price. We paid 10 euros for a cabin bag, printed our boarding pass. Weight was under the limit, so we did not leave any scope for airlines to charge us million.

The flight was smooth, enough leg space. Reached Brussels on time. The only thing was there was no bus ( don't even ask about the bridge, lol), so we have to walk to the plane that too in the rain but it was hardly 100 yards so yeah we are good.

Bottom line- if you are playing by their rules, you are good, otherwise, airlines suck everywhere ;)"|ryanair
703|"Yelp 100 Challenge 2019 - # 19/100

It's a no frills airline. Paid only £43 return trip from Dublin-Edinburgh for non-priority ticket. Or so I thought, only to be told we needed to pay £20 Each for carry-on luggage. You could save by paying online and it's £10. Lesson for the day: read your confirmation email and the fine print."|ryanair
704|"Ryanair gets a pretty bad rap. I heard nothing but grumbling from the frequent users. The two employees servicing the plane also complained about the company while taking off and landing. This seemed so bizarre to me because Ryanair allows customers to enjoy affordable travel throughout Europe. I would fall over to have the same affordable opportunity to travel within the U.S.

It cost $18.00 each way to fly from Ireland to Scotland. The flight was only 40 minutes long. You can have one bag stored for free and a second bag has a small charge. No free drinks or free food is offered. They do have drinks and food and take major credit cards for these items. You check yourself in using an app or pay a fee to go to the counter for assistance. The more independent you are the cheaper your flight will be."|ryanair
705|Totally not impressed. From LGW to DUB the flight was an hour delayed and another hour delay on the return. Paid for priority boarding which allowed for a carry-on and a personal item. While boarding, the staff was allowing pretty much everyone to bring on multiple bags without having to pay for the upgrade. On board the plane was filthy, with rubbish everywhere. The tray tables were sticky from a previous (or multiple) flights and the floor was covered in food.|ryanair
706|"I traveled with my baby and my husband and went to the airport over 2.5 hours early to check in and dropoff our luggage and baby equipment. The clerks took 45 minutes to check us in, couldn't read our passports nor was their ""equipment working."" The lines just to get our luggage tags were out the door. For this issue, by the time I was officially checked in, we were passed the 2-hour check in-requirement, where they charge you over $55 pounds a person as a penalty. That equates to over $200 American dollars, which is ridiculous!! I tried to inform someone at Ryanair about this and no one gives a shit. This airline is horrible, they give you the worst service and then punish you for their mistakes. I do not wish Ryanair upon anyone and hope viewers that read this choose other airlines for their travels. You've been warned, sincerely."|ryanair

708|I just watched a video that was quite disturbing. I have heard no word from the company issuing an apology to the elder who was belittled on her flight by another patron. The crew did nothing but give the older white caucasian what he requested. If as a company they do not take situations as such and correct them it will only promote others to do it as there are no restrictions, regulations or policies or procedures on how to react if such a thing where to happen again. I would really appreciate if the company responded or at the very lease acknowledge the disgusting behavior that they cater to. I'd recommend that this company not be utilized as it leaves one to wonder what other things might have happened that they have just swept under the rug. I've also signed a petition against the company.|ryanair

710|"Put it simple - I like Ryanair! They currently offer €9.99 Alicante - Paris prices (on selected days) and they are still having 2.5 stars on Yelp??? Are you kidding me? This is ridiculous and unfair!

There's one simple trick to be a happy Ryanair customer: pay attention to details while buying tickets. That's it. You will be ripped off for any of mistakes of your own. You will be fine if you understand their rules and follow them (You accept them when you buy the ticket btw).

Attention: don't misspell your name, make sure your cabin bag is within their limits, print the boarding pass in advance etc. They will tell you all those things multiple times during the reservation process, and yet there will always be people who won't notice and get screwed and unhappy.

The business model is simple - they do just ONE thing cheap - bring you from airport A to airport B without much luggage and without much service. Everything else - food, printing boarding passes, excessive luggage, changing flight dates is super expensive.

The planes are less convenient than ""high cost"" airlines. There's less space in front of you. The only free service on board is toilet. Enjoy it while it is still free :)

You pay for food and drinks on board (time to lose weight?). Remember - you pay 9€ instead of €200 - go dine in style on arrival :)

Quick tips for beginners:
- Make sure your cabin baggage is within their limits. They will check the size on boarding. They don't check cabin bag weight (at least I never saw that)
- Try flying without check in luggage (probably won't work for US tourists in Europe, works fine for short trips within Europe)
- Print your boarding pass yourself in advance
- Many airports are far from the destination city center, be prepared
- Try to avoid any changes in your reservation. They are expensive
- Use debit card instead of credit card when you pay online
- Read carefully all conditions and messages while buying tickets
- Assume there's no customer service
- Beware - you can't get much service for the prices you pay, don't expect anything. If you like convenience and top service - don't go with low cost, pay x3 elsewhere and enjoy :)

Positive:
- Personnel is friendly and polite  
- They arrive on time. Ryanair is one of the most punctual airlines out there (probably because they avoid busy airports). Delays are very rare!
- They are safe despite low rates. Safer than Alitalia, Air France, American Airlines, Iberia, US Airways, Japan Airlines, SAS. Source: jacdec.de/airline-safety…

I flew with Ryanair multiple times and I have problems only when those French air controllers go on strike again. You can't blame the airline for that, the controllers are beyond their control :)

Extra tip: If you are reading this just before the boarding and you are not sure your bag will pass their cabin luggage gauge test - put all your clothes on, remove stuff from your bag, put stuff into your pockets. Hurry up!

Final note: While on board - look left and right and say hi if I'm seating next to you. Please UFC this review, I tried hard to make it helpful :)))"|ryanair
711|One and done fir me with Ryan air.   Policies that don't match the rest of the industry paired with extremely indifferent customer service agents. I will Ky fly again. And would advise you to pay at least double somewhere else before considering it.   Good luck if you still book em.  Study up on how to make it a good experience|ryanair
712|"Not since flying AmericaWest (AmericaWorst) have I experienced such horrible service and crappy piloting.  

I took the 'not so' cheap route to Amsterdam from Dublin, and ended up paying €227 round trip for a last minute flight (within 3 hours of departure).  Not a big deal, but damn that's four times normal.  

Here's what I went through:
~ Plus one star for the helpful lady that assisted me with check-in at the Dublin airport.  Thinking this'll be great!
~ I board into a plane with thin seats.  You'll really get to know your neighbor easily.  These were probably the thinnest seats I've ever been in, and they just felt weak and cheaply made.
~ The ugly seats matched the company colors.  Didn't expect that, but my first reaction was, blaaah (hurl)!  The backrest seemed so thin that I feel I can punch a hole through it.  They don't have a seat pocket for convenience either.  
~ The pilot slamming the plane on the runway upon landing, AND he hard broke nearly turning the plane to its side, lol.
~ Folks definitely clapping because they're alive and survived that $#!tty landing.
~ Snooty snooty bad attitude from the counter staff upon checking in and heading back to Dublin. And that just about drew the final straw on the need to yelp about it.  There was no one in line at the Ryanair counter lady, so just print out my pass geez!
~ Oh yeah, and the app doesn't support non-EU folks to upload their boarding pass btw.  Non-EU folks have to find a printer, waste paper, and print their own pass.  Lame!  It's an app, so let everyone have that same boarding pass right!

This is basically the Southwest Airlines of Europe, only these guys make Southwest seem like the better healthier organic option.  I guess I'll have to resort to Ryanair if needed.  Ugggh, oh well, sucks!"|ryanair
713|If you are a person of color or just believe in the basic tenants of human decency , don't support this airline. After seeing their mishandling of a situation where a black woman was harassed and verbally abused wby another racist passenger and remedying the problem my making her move seats instead of the abuser and not removing him from the flight I guarantee I will NEVER use this airline.|ryanair
714|It's low cost yes, but not worth it.  I accidentally paid for two bags online and  extremely unhelpful customer service shared any mistakes online/app are non refundable.  But god forbid you don't book ahead of time for luggage as you'll get lots of fees at the airport.|ryanair
715|HORRIBLE AWFUL DECEITFUL COMPANY. Our flight was cancelled due to strikes, and we stood in line for hours trying to get a new flight in the Barcelona airport at 11 PM. They dispatched non Ryanair staff who didn't speak English with forms to coerce people out of line. They informed us there were no flights for two days we could book a new flight and Ryanair would reimburse us for all expenses: hotel, new flights, meals, taxis. For three of us this cost over $2000. They are now refusing compensate us! Unbelievable. We're in the process of filing a court claim and I suggest everyone who has experienced something similar do the same so this company is held responsible!|ryanair
716|"How can RyanAir still be in business? Uncomfortable seats, fraudulent upsells, appalling customer service - these are taken for granted. Yet... I write this at the Menorca airport after learning that my short flight to Barcelona has been delayed by one hour and twenty minutes.

Again and again they mess up. I will miss my planned engagement this evening and they again would need to struggle to be less concerned with the date of their passengers.

Any apparent savings from flying this low-cost airline are illusory. They will invent new fees, discover new charges, make you late, smash your bag. I will never fly Ryan Air again and neither should you."|ryanair
717|"Ryanair offers a standard, cheap service for flying in Europe. Dublin's hub was no different. It was a far walk to the gate, you pay a lot for extra weight in your baggage, and you're herded like cattle onto the plane.

You get used to it. It's hard to rate Ryanair any more or less than a three because you get what you pay for and you have to go into the situation knowing it won't be perfect. Thats just how the company is. They're not out to be the best. They're out to be the most affordable. And that's why I'll continue to use them.

I was grateful that my plane to Prague took off on time! Extra props for that."|ryanair
718|"Our one and only experience with RyanAir, flying out of Naples into Barcelona, was not pleasant at all. We stood in line while 1 person checked dozens of folks in. We were albeit forced to use the kiosk to check in, and I was trying to check a bag as it had a bottle of wine in it.
The kiosk would not take my American Express card. It would not let me switch to an alternate form of payment without starting over, however, which would become more than just an inconvenience.
I switched to my Visa credit card on the second attempt. It prompted me for a PIN (I only use PINs on debit cards). Round 3: I used my debit card and it accepted my PIN... it also told me I had exceeded my baggage limit  of 0 bags/0 pounds. It took my money, but did not print out a baggage ticket. The attendant at the desk could not help me and said she would call someone. I waited for a few minutes, but no one showed up.
After all of this, we had less than 15 minutes to get to our gate, so I ended up leaving an $80 bottle of wine (and just took my bag as a carry-on) as well as being out the $40 for the baggage check.
I contacted RyanAir first by submitting a web form. No response. I followed up with a chat session that also proved fruitless as they told me I just needed to wait ""7-10 days"". Well, it's been a month now with no response from RyanAir.
All I wanted was a refund on the $40 baggage charge.
So, with poorly run check-in's as well as zero customer service, I would certainly NOT recommend using this airline."|ryanair
719|"We were on vacation from the US, traveling from Dublin to London. I'd started the online check-in process the night before, but I got to the screen where it was asking about pre-paid seating assignments, and I guess I'd ended the process prematurely because I wasn't interested in paying for seats.  After waiting in line to check in and check our bags, we were redirected to the Customer Service line because we hadn't pre-checked in. While waiting, an airline attendant informed us that we would now have to pay 45 Euros each to check in. That's over $100 US - just to check in for a flight!

When we finally got to the front of the line, I explained to this attendant that we were not aware of this policy and had not received any notification. She said ""well, we emailed you and sent a message to the number on file."" I explained that we're traveling internationally, so we haven't had access to email and text messages. Her response was ""I can't give you a boarding pass for free. It's a pretty self-explanatory check-in process."" I was frustrated to the point of tears at this point - I couldn't believe the excessive cost just to get our boarding passes. We've never had to pay to check in for a flight before! We had priced dozens of flights for this trip, and there's a good chance that there was a better time/location alternative if we had taken this additional $100+ fee into consideration."|ryanair
720|"I just saw the terrible way they handled the racist man that ranted about the ""ugly black **********"" sitting next to him. The equally racist flight crew had the audacity to move the woman and let the ignorant racist man continue in his seat and flew him to his destination. How sick, rude and totally disgusting! DO NOT FLY RYANAIR!!!"|ryanair
721|I measured my carry on bag with a tape measure prior to leaving my house! It's a crew bag! I'm a flight attendant! The lady made both my father & I pay 50€ stating they were too big!! After my protesting, I gave in and spent the money. Upon boarding the aircraft there were BAGS BIGGER THAN MINE being carried on. Extremely infuriating. To add to the frustration the flight was 45min delayed!|ryanair
722|"They are greedy and not honest for their service and they just ask you always to pay extra .

Not recommended and don't waste your money .

No body in the airport listening to the problems or try to solve the issue even if their problems they just ask you to pay extra."|ryanair
723|"Do NOT fly RyanAir unless you want them to literally rob you of your money when THEY make a mistake and won't refund you because of their relentless ""no refund"" policy...

On Monday, April 3, 2018 I attempted to purchase a round trip flight from London to Budapest. After I put all of my credit card information in and hit buy/confirm, I got an error message saying that their was a problem with my card and the sale did not go through. I did not receive any sort of email, booking confirmation, reference number or anything: just an error message. I figured there was something wrong with their system and that I'd just try the next day. The next day, I tried again. The same exact thing happened again. Later I checked my credit card statement to see I had been charged twice for flight bookings that never actually went through. I never received ANY confirmation of these flights except finding out my card had been charged twice.

I called RyanAir immediately.

I explained what happened and apparently because of their no refund policy, they would not refund me for the extra flight. This lady also pulled booking numbers for both flights out of the woodwork and when I got off the phone with her, I magically had confirmation emails in my inbox time stamped during the time I was on the phone.

I was so enraged. I just canceled the charge on my credit card and refused to pay for the duplicate charge which again was THEIR FAULT.

And now I'm banned from flying RyanAir, and I'm not even upset about it. I don't want to give more money to an airline that LITERALLY ROBS their customers."|ryanair

725|Jan 2019, I was a first time customer of RyanAir. I even purchased priority boarding for my family, as I have little kids. When receiving my itinerary there was no instructions around the checking-in procedure. Nowhere did it say that online check-in was required or you will need to pay 55EUR/person. I did, however, get multiple emails about allowed luggage for the flight. So, I arrive at the airport, 2 hours early, and I was required to pay 55EUR/pp. There are 5 in my family! I was so pissed and checked my emails again and nowhere did it indicate that this was a requirement. Also, the family priority boarding is a total joke. There was no priority for my family. Thus, I am extremely hesitant to flying with RyanAir again due to it's lack of transparency and disregard to their customers. If one charges their customers a check-in fee of almost the same price of the ticket then one should have the decency to mention this requirement in the itinerary! Due to this, I am convinced that this imposed fee is to make an extra buck. If this fee would have been indicated clearly, I would have made an effort to find a wifi spot in my holiday country to check-in. But the reality is that I was in a holiday country with limited wifi. RyanAir, you lost a customer who contributes a significant amount of money to airlines all over the world.|ryanair
726|"I arrived 2:02 min before my flight. The man child behind the ticket counter told me that I must goto another counter to have my boarding pass printed for £50! I begrudgingly accepted and upon returning to his smug little face and informs me that they can't print tickets inside the two hour window before the flight. Never again will I fly Ryanair. My first and last experience.
I just presented my passport to Norwegian Air and it was printed for free, what a concept!"|ryanair
727|"One of the worse airlines I have ever flown on.  Got charged an outrageous fee for not checking in online.  More than the price of the ticket.  You better read that fine print and not assume this airline operates like all the others.  It does not and will nickel and dime you to death.  They made my husband toss his recently purchased coffee before boarding the plane because ""they don't allow hot drinks on board?""  Then they are willing to serve hot drinks at a charge while onboard....who does that?  I will never fly with them again, because even if another airline charges a little more, I won't be hit with ""small print charges.""  They also made me wait in line for over 25 minutes to tell me I was 10 minute shy of checking in online (2 hours ahead of time) in order to avoid the US dollar charge of $75 dollars a ticket.  CRAZY!  My baggage was less."|ryanair
728|"The worst airline I have ever seen. I will be disgusted to be associated with such shady and rip off operations. Charged $200 for not checking in online. Ended up paying almost $1000 for a 50 minute flight. Inside looks like a beat up old school bus. Crew sells lottery tickets and food like desperate street hawkers.
I can imagine how they must be cutting corners on their maintainence as well. I would rather built my own boat and sail next time or walk to my destination than take this airline next time."|ryanair
729|"RYANAIR IS THE WORST AIRLINE IN THE WORLD. It narrowly beats out Jet Blue.  Why?
1. They lie and are deceptive. The $29 ticket I bought wound up costing $200  after I pay for bags and a bizarre policy of not allowing checkin at the airport. First in my experience and completely secret and undisclosed.
2.Service is terrible. Every Ryanair employee was angry and hostile with the simplest of questions. But you can hardly blame them, they are probably getting screwed by Ryanair too.

I could go on but the current stars indicate that everyone feels the same.

SAVE YOURSELF AND AVOID THE TEMPTATION OF BUYING THISE FALSELY LOW FARES.

I only wish there were negative stars to better express my sentiment"|ryanair
730|Horrible horrible horrible!!  Charged me fees more than my ticket for not checking in online.  After holding me up in line for 25 minutes when I could have if I had known.  Sorry, this is a first from all my travels and besides making money, what is the reason you charge these enormous fees?  Then they made my husband discard his coffee because you can't bring a hot beverage on the plane, even though they serve them for a fee?  Greedy airline!   Never again!|ryanair
731|"If you go in knowing what to expect ahead of time, it's not too bad. Not extraordinary, either.  I was a first time user in October of this year & flew from Dublin to Liverpool & back.  I booked online in advance & went for a Business Class ticket, so I wouldn't have to deal with any extra fees for baggage & would be afforded a bit of time for priority boarding.

Unfortunately, on the way to Liverpool, because of a miscommunication, the time given to those of us for ""priority boarding was eliminated, as passengers were all stuck in a dark stairwell as as a previous flight unloaded.  I thought 'things can happen,' but on the way back to Dublin, priority boarding amounted to no more than a 10 second head start.  

Travelers should make sure that they print their boarding passes & have them with them to avoid any extra charges & if not traveling Business Class, be mindful of the weight of your bags.  

At just over 6'2,"" I remember being too tall to stand on the plane, but the crew was nice.  They only played the silly pre-recorded music on landing one way (apparently only the sticklers do),  & while they do sell lottery scratchers, it's for charity.  I didn't opt for any food purchases."|ryanair
732|"the only airline i've ever used (and i fly alot) that i've ever ...had... to check in online.  we were charged $150.00 for not checking in. our tickets were $160.00 total so our charge was doubled. i understand a fee, but $150.00 is entirely too extreme.

i will never use ryanair again."|ryanair
733|"""You can't pay for your baggage at the baggage check in""

I arrived at the airport 2 hours in advance of my domestic flight from Edinburgh to London. I proceeded through the queue to check my baggage at the automated kiosk. I weighed my bag and received an error message. The attendant  told me that I needed to go to the RyanAir check-in desk to check my bag. I did so, and the Ryanair attendant at the desk said she could not take my payment. She said I needed to go to the other end of the terminal to the Swissport Desk. I was already starting to worry about making it to the gate on time, but I didn't have any choice but to follow the attendant's orders.

So I crossed the terminal and waited in queue at the Swissport Desk for 40 minutes with several other people who were in the same situation. Everybody looked angry and worried because there was only one agent handling customers, and she was moving very slowly. When I finally got my turn, it was too late. The gate had closed. When I told this to the slow attendant, she was exceedingly rude, rearmking that I should have ""spoken up"" from the queue if I had an imminent flight. The problem was, every single person in the queue was in the same position that I was. Ryanair wasn't letting anybody pay for their baggage at the baggage desk! Was I supposed to cut in line?

Leaving on a later flight would've caused me to miss my connection in London, so I had to pay 70 pounds to take a train from Edinburgh to London so I could make the connection in time.

RyanAir has repeatedly refused to refund me for the Edinburgh-London part of the trip even though their attendants were at fault. Adding insult to injury, they keep sending me form letters which pointedly ignore the substance of my complaint. Essentially, they blame me for not taking ""a long security queue"" into account. I never even made it to the security queue!

Given my experiences and their well-documented human rights violations (which I found out about later) I will never fly this airline again."|ryanair
734|"Ryanair's computer system had a glitch and we were charged for it!

Glitch in their online booking tool put traveler's name down twice instead of name we added when making booking. Same person can't fly at the same time on the same flight. We don't notice until shortly before arriving for flight and they charge us $160 € to change it to the person it should have been to begin with in the first place. We shouldn't have to pay for their system glitch!

First time using Ryanair and it was a bad experience. Be careful and check your booking details carefully."|ryanair
735|"Athens to Santorini.

Website unclear about additional fees and what counts for cabin bags and what can be checked. I was charged €210 for weight overages on my check bags because 15kg is an unrealistic number for anyone traveling for an extended period. I would say classic bait and switch but I suppose it's just oversight on my part.

I realize now that I may have been able to pay €50 to check an additional  bag to shave weight of my other two(?) Maybe the ticket attendant  could have told me that but, we all hate those pesky Americans am I right ;)

Do yourself a favor and take a ferry boat from Athens...

Avoid at all cost... And I mean COST! You get what you pay for."|ryanair
736|"Probably the worse scam ever of my life!
Ended up paying twice when I booked through cheapoair all because Ryanair website was not accessible to check in on-line 2 hours before flight. The irony of not being able to check in 2 hours before the flight was - I was charged more at the airport than what I originally paid for the tickets from cheapoair. Literally paid more than double.  But before I paid (again at the airport), I called customer service for help.  They were of no help in walking me through the website rynair.com that was directing me to some other website.  Hidden fees for cabin luggage that wasn't disclosed in addition to check-in bags contributed to the charges more than double.  An e-mail with a link would have been helpful in fulfilling their two-hour preflight mandatory on-line check in would have been helpful, but no email was sent.  I think they bank on this not being done so they can charge you again what you originally paid for the tickets.  I believe RYANAIR is a huge fraudulent scam.  I wouldn't recommend anyone go through this agency for air travel. They are terrible."|ryanair
737|"I rarely take the time to write reviews, but I feel it necessary to warn people about Ryanair. I tried to check in online before my flight, but neither their app or their website were working. I figured, ""No worries. I'll just check in at the airport. I don't even have any bags to check"". But when I got to the ticket counter I was informed that because I did not check in online I would be charged a 55 Euro ""check in fee"". I was at the ticket counter an hour and a half before my flight, but they told me you could only check in in person 2 hours before a flight to avoid the 55 Euro fee? I've never heard of ANY other airline doing something like this. I asked if I had any other options since I had tried to check in via their app and website which had not been working. I was rudely told ""Pay the fee now, or get out of line and don't fly with us."" To top it all off, the exchange rate to US dollars made my fee increase to $61.52. They also charged the two people I was traveling with, so in total we paid $184.56 for a ""check in fee"". Ryanair must make a fortune doing this to people. Don't let them do this to you! Don't fly Ryanair!"|ryanair
738|"Worst Airline Ever. You must check in at least 2 hours before hand. AND NO ONE TELLS YOU OR HELPS YOU. The lines are too long and it cost us more for ""late arrival"" (we were at the airport 1 hr and 30 mins before hand) than for the original ticket. Only 1 very nice lady helped us while everyone else we encountered couldn't care less. They charge you for drinks in the flight and don't tell you. Too cramped, no entertainment, and all around horrible airline."|ryanair
739|Choosing Ryanair is good for low fares, but the customer service is awful. I was precluded from flying last year for medical reasons. Three times Ryanair asked for a letter from my doctor in order to process a refund, and three times I've supplied the letter. And three times they've denied the refund, even though they stated the letter was all they needed. And each time the customer service agent has gotten nastier and nastier.|ryanair
740|"As an American traveling with RyanAir I was pleasantly surprised. I've read many horror stories online, but was able to have a great experience flying from Gatwick to Dublin as well as from Dublin to Edinburgh. A few things you should know before flying with them:

* Non-EU citizens need to show their passport to the check in clerk and get their boarding pass stamped. This can be frustrating if you have a connecting flight. In my case I flew in from the US to London and had to go through customs, exit security, get my boarding pass stamped and then re-enter security before being able to catch a flight to Dublin
* Seats are extremely small and can be uncomfortable for those who are a little larger. For short flights though( less than an hour and a half) it's not much of a problem - just sit down and use the restroom before your board ;)
* They WILL charge you for luggage and oversized carry ons. I saw them stop one man to measure his carry on. I avoided the fee by carrying on a small duffle bag.

Overall, the flights are so cheap that it's hard to be mad. I was able to fly from Dublin to Edinburg for around $25 USD. There are absolutely NO domestic flights in the US for that cheap!! I can barely get from San Francisco to Los Angeles for $40. I'll continue to ride with RyanAir whenever I'm in Europe!"|ryanair
741|"The absolute worst costumer service in Munich!  The person at the counter told me to listen to him.  I did then asked him to listen to me and he responded ""no-I will not listen to you"" and walked away!  There other guy (And) yelled at me and said "" I have explained this to you.... but he did not explain anything!  He only could say ""I don't know"" yelling but not offering any help!!!
I will NEVER use this airline again and I will tell all my family and friends!"|ryanair
742|"Terrible customer service.  Had never flown with them before and learned the day of that we had to check in earlier than 2 hours before our flight. We missed the deadline by minutes...the people that we dealt with to resolve the issue, as Ryanair put it on our added fees, ""boarding pass issues"" were rude. The cost of our flight essentially Doubled!   I understand that we failed to see their policy,  but you would think they'd make an effort to emphasize that policy to new customers."|ryanair
743|Of the six times I flew with Ryanir whilst in Europe, I haven't had a good experience. They are always tardy when it comes to departures. The departure times seems to always be the time they let customers through the gate. Don't be fooled, once one is passed the gate, you have to wait again to actually board the aircraft. They are somehow always below the 3hr requirement for delay complaints. If anything, fly Alitalia in Italy. At least they depart on time.|ryanair
744|"I only gave this review 1 star because negative numbers were not available. Ryanair is THE WORST company I have ever done business with.

While touring Europe, we arrived over 2 hours early in Prague for a flight to Rome. We were not allowed to check into our flight online, because we refused to pay extra to choose our seats. We were then unable to check in at the self-help kiosk at the airport as we would have been able to do on any other airline. So, we proceeded to the desk.

There was a line a mile long and only 1 worker, who spent most of his time flirting with the ladies on either side of him working for other airlines. We were in line for well over an hour.

When we finally began check in, we were told that because we had not checked in at least 2 hours prior to flight time, we would be charged $60 per person for boarding passes. We arrived in plenty of time to use our phones to check in, had the worker been doing his job and gotten us through the line in time. When we complained, the flirty jerk told us there was nothing he could do and that we would have to get out of line and go to an office across the airport lobby to pay the fees and receive our boarding passes.

While waiting for our passes, we very calmly and diplomatically expressed our disdain over the fees and inquired about who we could contact to complain. The worker simply pointed to a posted warning about how that we could be arrested for harassing any airport employee. Then, we had to get back in line and wait some more.

We had issues with our return flight and tried to contact customer service to ask questions to make sure we were not going to be charged the ridiculous fees again. Customer service for Ryanair is totally non-existent. You cannot contact anyone by phone, only by email. We wanted to know if we could use electronic boarding passes or if we would have to find somewhere to get them printed. Still waiting for an answer the next day, we walked over a mile to find a Mailboxes Etc. to print the passes. When we got to the airport, we decided to test the system and used the electronic passes, which worked fine. Ryanair finally returned my email AFTER our flight, instructing us that we would have to print the passes, because electronic passes would not be acceptable. Well, apparently they were wrong.

When we went to board the plane, we were made to stand in line for nearly an hour. Inspectors walked up and down the line searching for oversized luggage that would have to be checked. I guess flirty jerk at the desk wasn't paying attention. We were then herded like cattle to crowded buses that carried us across the tarmac to the plane.

Onboard the plane, the crew was bored and robotic. They charged for everything. The seats were very uncomfortable.

Worst customer service I have ever encountered from a company. Will never use Ryanair again."|ryanair
745|"Guys...you get what you pay for...therefore there's no need for complaining! For me, Ryanair was an experience while traveling all over Europe. During my 17 days trip all over Ireland and Spain, I've probably used Ryanair about 5x and each trip was about 20-30 euros. It was super cheap and it was less expensive and quicker than the train or ferry.

Here's what to expect:
1) Avoid bringing a luggage more than 15kg (which is about 33 pounds) or else you'll be charged a fee. I went during the summertime so this wasn't an issue. My friend, on the other hand, had a little bit of trouble because she went on a shopping spree but she managed by wearing many of the stuff she bought.

2) Check-in online to avoid any boarding pass fees.

3)There's no assigned seats, so make sure you get there early. Seats are first come, first served. (Cristin L just told me that they assign seats now... hooray!!!)

4)One thing I found HILARIOUS, was that everyone claps every time the plane landed. In my head, I was wondering should I be happy or terrified. Happy - because it's traditions or Terrified - because the plane landed safely and I'm alive in one piece.

Plan ahead and save yourself the hassle! Good luck!"|ryanair
746|"Ryanair - well, I was just at a conference where their Chief Marketing Officer told us all about the turnaround of a brand with a reputation for lackluster customer service and how they have been working hard over the past 18 months to get things going in a better direction.

Based on this - I really didn't know what to expect - but my ""business"" fare was about $69 and that included my bag on board.  The flight was Dublin to London- Gatwick a flight of about an hour.

Things I noticed:
- Seats very close together
- You don't get to walk down a jetway - you walk outside, and up the stairs of the aircraft.
- There are no seat back pockets.  There is a sticker on back of the seat in front of you giving you the safety demonstration.
- There isn't a free beverage or snack on board.
- Checking your bag is not free - which is why the business ticket made sense for me.

The cabin crew was very polite and courteous (however the girl speaking over the PA system had a very thick accent and it made it very hard to understand)

I would not hesitate to fly them again in the future- certainly based on their value proposition.  The CEO came to the USA and shadowed Southwest Airlines back in the day - and has rolled out a similar concept in Europe."|ryanair
747|"55 euros to print a boarding pass! Ryanair, why do you hate your customers so much?!

They claim to be the low price leader and that means cutting costs, but punitive measures like these that no other airline use just end up disenfranchising new customers. And tell me in huge print to check in if its going to be 50% of the ticket price to print out a piece of paper."|ryanair
748|Stay away from this airline.  I am thinking this is their modus operandi in order to get more money from you.  We decided to physically check in because our birthdates were off by a day on all of the 4 passengers in Ryanair's computer system.  On our flight day, we got there on the desk more than 2 hours before departure but the staff asked us to check in at their computer kiosk.  We tried, but our birthdates were still off on their kiosk till we were already within  2 hour before our departure which means that we needed to pay 55 Euros x 4 for checking in.  When I got back home, I emailed them for a refund because truly, we could have check ourselves in, if not for our off birthdates in their system but their customer service sucks, they do not take this as a safety consideration.  Back here in America, airlines are very particular if the information you have in your passport is the same as theirs in their system.  I guess this airline is not particular with that, whether they have the right person boarding their plane or not, because I really believed that the staff who checked us in after we paid a whooping 220 Euros, did not even check if our birthdates are the same us that in their computer system.|ryanair
749|"Ryanair, the airline that you love to hate.

The good
- You can get flights for super cheap. I went to Brussels for the weekend for £50 return.
- The flights are generally on time.
- They now let you take a small handbag as well as a trolley case onboard so you don't have to stuff your handbag in.

The not good
- Don't expect customer service from them. Seriously they don't care.
- The airports aren't always the main ones, so check how easy, expensive and long it will take to get to the city center from them.
- The luggage rules are super strict. If you are 1/4 inch above the maximum size they will stop you getting on the plane with it and charge you a ridiculous amount to check it it.
- Actually the rules in general, make sure you follow them or they'll charge you at least €40 to reprint your boarding pass or check in an item or pretty much make any changes.
- The stupid fan fair to say that you've landed on time. Just annoying.

So follow the rules, play the game and you can go away very cheaply and easily. Just hope that you aren't too delayed."|ryanair
750|"We flew Ryanair from Santiago to Barcelona.  The day before we left they sent me an email in Spainish which fortunately I looked at.  Since I don't speak Spanish i asked our waitress who speaks fluent (a native) spanish and English to tell me what it said.  She said ""they want you to check your bags"" (not carryons).  Well that wasn't correct apparently.

When we got there they told us they had sent us an email that said to print out our boarding passes ahead of time or we would be charged for them!  They charged us $50 for printing!!!"|ryanair
751|"... I swear to gosh, there must be some wager between Ryanair pilots on how high they can bounce the airplane on landing... of my last four Ryanair flights, we literally ricocheted off the tarmac. It's like the entire company is playing a really high stakes game of airplane jacks.

But i'm not an overly nervous flyer, so besides all the momentary praying for ones life I encounter during each and every trip, I don't mind Ryanair. Sure, the seats are cramped, the flights are always late and the staff are usually underwhelming at best.... but I can fly to another city for under £50. Coming from the land of extraordinarily expensive travel (Canada), this is a gosh darn revelation. Plus, unlike some of the other budget airlines, Ryanair lets you bring a handbag AND a carry on, so I don't spend the ten minutes before boarding trying to stuff one into the other.

If I had the means, I would happily travel on another airline and never, ever look back but so long as I'm counting pennies, Ryanair is a necessary and decently bearable evil."|ryanair
752|"Worst airline ever!! Make sure you read all the fine prints...they will do everything to take advantage of you. You might even get charged to breath on their planes or to use the toilets on board. If you forget to check in online it is $100.  The are not to be trusted and are definitely not worth the risk.
They have the worst customer service ever! Ryanair is like a mean girlfriend or boyfriend that can't wait to get revenge from you so watch your back and hold on to your wallet."|ryanair
753|"DO NOT FLY WITH RYANAIR!!

What a terrible company and a bunch of thieves. They will charge you extra for not booking your ticket in advance. They will lie to your face and try to get you to pay more than you have to. They will tell you they don't accept cash when they actually do... And then taunt you with the fact they won't give you your money back.
They will tell you to call customer service except.. They don't have a working number!!

I implore you to avoid this company at all costs or you will end up paying for it through hidden fees.

Safe travels."|ryanair
754|Don't fly Ryanair if you have a choice . They are totally BS company . With horrible costumer service .  And they make you pay 65$ to check a big no matter the size  . Which is more then the roundtrip flight to from Athens to Santorini . DONT FLY with them .|ryanair
755|"WHY DIDN'T I READ THESE REVIEWS SOONER!!!??

Had I not almost accidentally wanted to review my itinerary, i wouldn't have seen that I was charged 84$ in FEES on a 54$ ticket!  They say that there is a fee to change the reservation, even weeks out, but at no time was I prompted to approve these fees.

I went on CHAT via the website, and ""peter p"" basically told me, after I requested that a manager make a decision since ""peter"" said he could not reverse fees, that ""you'll be receiving an email in 7 days from a representative"".  I protested that I leave the country in 7 days and that I needed a resolution sooner... he never answered.  

I then called internationally and spoke to a slavic man who was nice enough, but whose manager bluntly refused any accommodation, any help, knowing I was a first time customer -- and the attendant literally said, ""next time buy business plus"".  

Why didn't they offer to remove the fees, let's say, and have me buy a business plus ticket on the spot?

There is NEVER a good excuse to treat any customer like this, especially one as respectful as I was during the whole process.

Of course, I have instructed my credit card to stop all payments to this atrocious airline, and I'll be taking a bus, a car, a train, or the competition.

AWFUL, just awful way to treat a new and an eager customer!!!"|ryanair
756|"Predatory airline!

I get the fees. They make sense to me. Charge for drinks baggage and all that. That makes sense. But I arrive at the airport 90 minutes before my flight and went to get a boarding pass and they are like boarding pass please. I say jokingly, you are the airline, I believe I should be asking you for a boarding pass. That quickly escalated into a very unpleasant situation.

They said I can't board without a boarding pass and I can't print one. The only way to board is to give them 90 euro to print the two passes. That's just praying on young, poor, elderly or first timers. Basically they held me at ransom. I had to pay, no choice. I was livid. Absolutely livid.

Had it been like 10 euro and had they blasted me with a ""print your boarding pass or else"" email, I would even get it, they are streamlining. But this was Robbery at gun point, no two ways about it.

No way in hell I'm flying with thieves again. I'll pay double just to not give them another dime."|ryanair
757|"Dear tourists,
DO NOT buy flight tickets from this company.
I flew  with Ryanair from ibiza to Barcelona and I must say it was one of my worst experiences with an airline. As a traveller, I've been to many countries  (European, middle east, south and central  America ) and never came across such terrible and agressive people.
They will not give you an answer, sending you from one office to another to waste your time.
Do not buy from them, it seems cheap at first but will cost more with their hidden fees.
If you choose to fly with them,  read the Terms and Conditions because they will use it against you to avoid any responsibilities."|ryanair
758|"BEWARE, PREDATORY AND MISLEADING BUSINESS PRACTICES. READ IF YOURE CONCERNED ABOUT WHY YOUR FLIGHT IS SO CHEAP.

I take no pleasure in writing any reviews, much less nasty ones, but Ryanair is especially deserving of public consumer feedback.

This is the poorest excuse for an airline imaginable. I booked a flight from Berlin to Madrid and paid the extra fee online for a checked bag. No problem. At 4 AM, 5 hours before my flight while I'm asleep, Ryanair sends an innocuous looking email stating that, because of a baggage worker strike, they could not check any luggage onto my flight. I have a massive bag with 4 bottles of scotch that I'm bringing home, so carrying on was not an option.

The women behind the ticket counter at Schönefeld were beyond rude and bounced me over to the equally as rude ticket counter women, who informed me that I had to call Ryanair directly to discuss a refund.

Called to ask for a refund to find that Ryanair has disconnected their international customer service number, and couldn't get an answer from any regional number.

Beyond blatantly hiding the baggage worker strike from customers until it's too late (also no mention of the strike on their website) they try to mislead you into believing that it is a general workers strike that they have no control over, even specifically saying they have no control in the email. THIS IS A LIE. ONLY the Ryanair baggage handlers are striking because the company is cutting their pay by 30% and firing most of them. Every other airline can get into Madrid with 0 issues because they're legit companies.

I really and truly take no pleasure in writing nasty Yelp reviews, but this was by far and away the worst experience I've had with a specific company. The saga ended with me spending 50 euros to take a cab to Tegel airport and booking an equally as cheap flight with AirBerlin several hours later. So much for saving money."|ryanair
759|"If you could drive instead...DO IT...its worse than Frontier in the states.

We couldn't get the site to work to checkin online ahead of time so we got their early...they charged us 45€ a piece. First they made us go back and forth from ticket counters and then charged us 45€ per ticket. I tried talking to managers but they just laughed at us.

When we went back to the ticket counter they lost the information on us checking our bags and I wasn't about to pay for them again so we had to toss all the liquids before security. When we got to the gate the flight was too full so they took our luggage anyway.

We got on the flight and it was as if you gutted a plane and put child sized lawn chairs in as seats. On the flight they try to sell you everything they possibly can.

At the end of the day you are going to be annoyed with the fees they pop on you. If its not one thing it will be something else. Just save yourself"|ryanair
760|"Honestly, the 5 stars says it all. You pay for what you get.Ryan air is an airline that tells you how it is. You bring 3 bags? you have to pay. if you dont get in line right away when boarding, they will make you check your bag. This is no surprise! People who complain are used to flying united or Aer Lingus with the extras added in. You know the prices are amazing when you can go to Madrid cheaper than i can go to the west of Ireland from Dublin by train.

Ryan air is so cheap because you are buying the most basic services. if you want to bring a load of bags, you can! You just have to pay for them which is fair when you look at how cheap your flights are.

They are one of the only airlines that actually does sales that are very impressive and they have a good business plan to keep costs down. It makes sense and I look forward to my next flight on Ryan Air.

My only negative is how much crap they try to sell you during the flight. Especially when you take a 6am flight and they dim the lights for take off, most airlines would allow the lights to stay dimmed or maybe turn a few aisle lights on, however, Ryan Air turns every single light on while they try to sell you stuff. I guess they figure the more lights on, the less likely we are to sleep!

Keep the cheap flights coming!!"|ryanair
761|"I had a flight booked from STN to DUB on Nov 15 at 17:00. Due to a 30 minute delay on the bus from London to Stansted, and also to a huge traffic jam all the way from the city, I got to the gate a few minutes after it was closed. To put me on the next flight, the ""low fare airline"" Ryanair charged me the ABSURD fee of £105. Even when there were about 5 seats available on the next flight, according to the representative who took my plight. Meaning, I paid extra £105 for a flight that had previously costed me €5. I fly a lot, and had my fair share of issues like that in the past... All other airlines, with NO exception, are willing to accommodate this kind of extreme situation, except for Ryanair. Poorly managed, terrible customer service, and on top of it all, they make it extremely hard for people to complain (try and look for their Customer Service number). AVOID RYANAIR AT ALL COST, cheap is not always better.

In reply to my complaint, Ryanair said that charging me that absurd fee was a ""GESTURE OF GOODWILL"" for the fact that I was late so, according to them, the fault was all mine, no matter what the situation was, and screw the fact that the next flight was not at all fully booked. Turns out, when I boarded, I realized there were way more than 5 seats available. THIS SO CALLED AIRLINE IS JUST DISGUSTING."|ryanair
762|They charge you +20Eur if you have a digital boarding pass to print it out-- if you're not an EU citizen you must print it out and have it stamped. It's a rip off-- first airline I've heard that charges to check in and print a boarding pass. First time and last time, RyanAir.|ryanair
763|"Always up for a challenge and an opportunity for amusement.--that's me. :)  When my French cousin told me about a ridiculously cheap Irish airline that flew all over Europe with the only catch being that passengers are only allowed one carry-on, I knew there was a game in the making. Could I do it? Could I travel all over Europe for 2 weeks, with everything I own in one small bag? None of my friends thought I could! ""Wait? Mel is actually going to wear a backpack?!""

No hitchhiking and staying in hostels for this lady, but flying to obscure airports with strange times and jumping from country to country for as low as $40 a ticket! Searching for months for the coolest backpack I could find, I planned with precision. The game was on!

This airline frequently has crazy cheap sales on tickets. They're cheap every day but look for the specials! Also, know that you absolutely have to get there early or they'll give away your seat. They also fly out of smaller airports. This means that if you want to get to or from the London area, you aren't flying to Heathrow; you're taking an hour train to or from Stansted Airport instead. Inconvenient, yes, but for a $40 ticket to Pisa, Italy, you get over your inconvenience.

These cheap tickets come at a price though. --the planes are not in good condition. I still laugh when I think of the part from the overhead bin that FELL OFF right in front of me as I sat waiting for take-off. Ha! An off-duty pilot jumped up, popped it back on and shrugged with his sexy Irish accent ""Don't worry, it's as good as new!"". Yikes! Not what I wanted to see!! For a little bit more money, you can reserve seats, which effectively makes you a ""first class"" passenger. The seats aren't any larger, nor are they more comfortable; you just get to sit in the section that is roped off at the front of the plane. --Worth the money to me to pick my seat, sit away from the crowds of people, and be able to get off quickly. ""First class"" had really not awarded me anything in the way of freebies though. -- But it did award me ear shot seats of the flight attendants' hilariously snarky comments about my fellow passengers! ;)

No beverages on these flights. Remember, this is a bare bones, no frills ticket. Instead, they go up and down the isle, selling duty free perfumes and lotto tickets.

While I can't say I would try that again, I look back and laugh at the time I hopped from country to country on rundown airplanes, landing sometimes in the middle of nowhere... all while wearing all of my belongings on my back.--You have not lived until you have had to send your underwear out to be laundered at every hotel... and it comes back on hangers! :D A trip I will never forget and yet never repeat!

Try it. I dare you."|ryanair
764|"I am always happy enough to book flights with Ryanair...you get exactly what you pay for. Bag or no Bag....Online Check or pay in the airport......like them or hate them they have brought competition to a sector that mostly only the ""more well off"" people could afford. I remember a day where we had to pay off our flight to London over a few months.....now the whole of Europe is assessable for a fare price. Thanks to Ryanair, i've seen so many places in Europe i'd never been too before...or could afford!! Most recently Manchester return for €15....wouldn't get to Carlow for that!!

Well, what an improvement!! Thankfully in the past year, there has been alot of improvements....you are now able to select a seat free of charge (yet people still Q like crazy people), bring an extra small bag with you and the staff have become somewhat friendly. What a transformation.

Well the way i look at it.....if you don't like them, don't fly with them, but you can't deny the fact that all other airlines have brought their prices down to be in competition with Ryanair. They only got 4 stars.....cause there is always room for improvement!!"|ryanair
765|Such a crap airline. Been flying my whole life and have never been required to check-in online before a flight. 55 euros per person is absolutely insane and such a rip off. Scam.|ryanair
766|"Not only is this airline very poor and unreliable but the customer service is majorly lacking. I get multiple emails about my flight being changed which could seem helpful but at the end of the day is just very tedious and unnecessary considering there are never actually any changes to my flight. On my trip to Paris from Dublin, The woman scanning passports and boarding passes told me that as a Ryanair employee she had the right to send me back to check in and cause me to miss my flight. Normally I would understand my own fault in not taking the proper steps for boarding but I had flown with Ryanair before and this had never been an issue and the way she told me that ""if she wanted"" she could quite literally deny my access to the plane and purposefully cause my to miss my flight was rather off putting. The flights can be cheap but if you can avoid this airline, I would highly recommend you fly with another airline."|ryanair
767|This is literally the worst airlines existing in civilized world. You pay extra for everything and cant even bring your handbag into cabin.

The plane is dirty beyond believe, I was at rubbish dump that was cleaner than this plane. And prices? Not that cheap either. Flight from Ireland to Poland and back costed me close to 200e and that is in October so completely off season when there is smallest interest. Is that so cheap?

We got to the check-in desk (not queuing in the line) at 10:18am, the staff tried to check in our luggage, he found that belt was not working. Then he contacted another staff and he told us the baggage could not be checked in because the service already closed 4 mins ago. This is not reasonable! The baggage drop should be available till 10:20am because it is your policy and it has been written on the boarding pass! We are very disappointed and argued with him. Later he told us that we would be changed to the flight on 2pm 10 Jan 2017. We had no choice but agreed. However, when we checked in at 1pm, the new staff working in the afternoon told us that our flight is not changed to 2pm and we need to buy a new ticket. This is CRAZY! The guy in the morning mentioned nothing about buying new tickets and new baggage allowance and just told us that we are changed to the 2pm flight! In the morning, he just wanted to walk away because he was close to get off work at that time in the morning! We had no choice but paid around 200 pounds in the airport to buy 2 new flight tickets and another 1x 15kg and 2x 20kg checked luggage allowance!

Here are the problems of RyanAir check-in service in London Lution:

1. WE DID NOT MISS THE FLIGHT FR2679 because we are late, but because your baggage check-in service in London Lution closed early without notifying customers.
2. Your staff told us we were changed to 2pm flight but without mentioning new tickets should be bought and other fee will be charged
3. The attitude of the guy working in the morning on 10 Jan 2017 is careless and not caring about customers. He just wanted to walk away probabably because he was expected to go off work when the time close to 10:20am on 10 Jan 2017.

I request for a full refund for the flight FR2679. This was a nightmare. For my flight from London to Copenhagen, my friend and I spent almost 300 pounds on it (ticket fee and baggage allowance fee for FR2679 11am is 10 Jan 2017 around 100 pounds, and the ticket fee and baggage allowance fee for the RyanAir flight on 2pm 10 Jan 2017 is around 200 pounds). And we write to customer service but receive no response!! really disappointed at this greedy and unprofessional company"|ryanair
770|IT IS THE ONE OF THE WORST AIRLINES IVE EVER TAKEN IN MY LIFE...super irresponsible customer service and vague guidelines!!!!...my flight was cancelled from Milan to Seville due to the French strike in Oct 2017. They rescheduled me to a new flight 1 week from the date I was supposed to take my flight. I was told that I will be reimbursed for any reasonable expenses during the week. However, NO ONE TOLD ME WHAT DOES REASONABLE mean? I emailed/called and live chatted with them and STILL NO ONE CAN TELL ME WHAT DOES REASONABLE MEAN? I said does $100/night for airbnb reasonable because come on! it is Milan!!!! I was told yes, it should be reasonable. After I submitted my reimbursement, not only they only willing to pay me back less than 50% of what I submitted, they also refused to talk to me about why were my expenses not reasonable.

The sticker price might be cheap, but they will find a way to rip you off. Their online check-in screws up? That's a 50 euro charge to you. Your bag is 10.7 kg instead of 10? That's a 35 euro charge, or 50.

It's a pretty shit airlines, the customer service blows, and they charge you for water on the plane. Hell, they charge you for everything they can. Also, they never run on time, as the only important thing to them is filling every plane to 100% capacity."|ryanair
773|"Absolutely DO NOT fly with this airline. For the sake of standing up against dishonest businesses, boycott such airlines. Google flights will help you find affordable prices with other reputable airlines through the year.

I am an avid traveler and have been traveling around the world since I was born, pretty much. I've grown accustomed to what to expect from good and bad airlines. When I traveled around Europe this time I did not know the notorious reputation that Ryanair had for ripping its customers off. Remember that discounted airline companies like this will try to make money using other methods to make up for what they're not charging you.

I booked my flight from Rome to Barcelona and did not receive a confirmation email or reminder to check in. So far, none of the airline companies I had flown with had let me check in online so I decided to arrive early at the airport and check in then just to be sure. The day before my flight, I received a text in Spanish and no email whatsoever. I thought the text was spam because I don't read or understand Spanish. When I showed up at the airport early to check in, the lady at the check-in counter (also know that Ryanair is known for its terrible staff and horrendous service, but I was a student backpacking on a budget) was extremely rude and literally said that she would be happy to let me miss my flight that morning unless I pay an extra 50 euros as a penalty for not checking in online. Instead of paying a total of 149 euros to fly from Rome to Barca, they made me pay a total of an extra 100 euros for in-airport check-in and baggage check-in (oversized baggage check-in is allowed so you don't have to pay an extra 50 euros for checking in your one carry-on item by the way). Many many airlines, specifically in European countries, hide this and lie to you to make you pay the extra 30-50 euros so keep that in mind.

All in all, I could have flown with a more prestigious airline and paid the extra 100 euros for good service versus the distress Ryanair cost me. Always remember that airlines like this never run on honest business. That's a huge lesson I learned while backpacking this time. After this scarring experience, I've chosen to boycott Ryanair with a passion. If you want to have an affordable but comfortable experience, I really recommend you avoid this airline. It really isn't worth it. I can officially say I would've had a more pleasant memory of my overall experience if this hadn't happened."|ryanair
774|"Ryanair is THE airline if you don't mind flying like a hitch-hiker. Fly cheap (almost for free) with as your only luggage your carry-on. You'll be able to see Europe for 'dirt' cheap.

So if you want to see Europe and you don't mind roughing it, Ryanair is the place to be.

In reference to the error in the ticket, I have had a ticket that said I was Mr. Alexandra M. and a male friend had a ticket saying Mrs. Nolin G and they didn't care there (we were super worried they wouldn't let us bored).

I love how cheap they are, when I was making good money in Dublin, my friends and I would check their website all the time to see where we can go for 5 euros in a few weekends (Scotland! and another time Sweden was 30 euros)."|ryanair

The attendants had said for people to sit with the seat belts fastened - the kids kept running and screaming - 2 kids refused to sit, the flight attendants said nothing.

RyanAir is a low-cost, no-frills airline.  I get that, and I appreciate the option of flying cheap around Europe.  However, it's also the Bait and Switch airline, and my experience with them has been so frustrating that I will never fly RyanAir again.

For starters, I booked with them both because of the low cost and the convenient departure times the offered.  But between booking and departure, the departure times of both of my flights were moved up by over two hours, making one of my flights extremely inconvenient.  In contacting customer service I received a boilerplate response telling me that i was not entitled to a refund due to change in schedule.

When I went to check in, I learned that their check-in procedures had changed since my booking, and that I would now need to pay to reserve a seat.  The procedures I had read when booking, and which was PRINTED ON MY EMAIL CONFIRMATIONS, were out of date.  Again, I contacted customer service, and received a boilerplate response.

The uncomfortable seats and the in-flight bombardment of advertisements I can live with... what I always hear about RyanAir is that you get what you pay for.  But you actually should get what you paid for, and not have the schedule, terms and conditions, and even the cost of your flight change after you're already booked and locked in."|ryanair
779|"First time flying Ryan Air and probably won't be back.  I paid extra and upgraded our tickets for preferred boarding and seat selection.  Well, their idea of preferred or early boarding is to be the first customers to be allowed onto a bus which gets jammed like sardines in a can.  Then everyone gets to board the plane at the same time.  They should be more specific that they are only selling first access to an overcrowded bus, not to the airplane.  

Then, to make it even worse they drove the bus to the plane and then kept all of us in a non airconditioned bus packed to the gills in the baking Spanish sun.  I was very nearly ready to break a window to escape the pending heat exhaustion.  Never, ever seen such poor consideration for the customers baking in the bus."|ryanair
780|Always , always delayed!!! I have taken this plane twice and both times they were delayed arriving to us, delayed on the tar mat, delayed landing, and delayed to the destination. Not small delays... LONG delays. Whether it's out of their control or not, it always seems to happen on Ryanair.|ryanair
781|"Truly the WORST airline I have ever flown -- and I've flown a lot. I guess you get what you pay for...

I was pulled from the line and charged £50 because my luggage bag was very slightly bigger than their size restrictions for carryon baggage. I was originally fine with this, but then I saw two people with carryon bags almost twice the size of mine get away with it -- they were not pulled away and just let boarding through smoothly.

My friend pointed out to me that it might be discrimination from the boarding staff since the two people who got away with oversized bags were pale blondes, and I'm Asian. I brushed off the idea and thought my friend was just being ridiculous. However, the staff then scolded an Indian couple with a crying baby. Mind you, the baby had a weak cry; it wasn't one of those loud, powerful, nonstop cries. However, two white families had three to four toddlers running around, screaming at each other, and just being plain obnoxious in the crowded boarding area. The staff did not say anything to them when they knew perfectly well that the kids were being disrespectful and annoying to the other waiting passengers.

On the plane, they would stop making announcement about the products they are selling. We were on a 5a.m. flight and everyone on the plane was trying to get some rest. Other airlines would dim the lights and make it as comfortable as possible for passengers to sleep. Obviously, nonstop promotion of in-flight products available wont result in sales; if anything, they simply lost potential customers from annoying the crap out of everyone."|ryanair
782|"My husband and I traveled in December to several destinations in England and Ireland. In the middle of our trip, on December 23rd, we had a Ryanair flight from Dublin to Manchester. We had checked in 2 hours prior to flight time and it was a direct flight. The flight was fine -no complaints. But upon arrival in Manchester, my suitcase arrived but my husband's was no where to be found. We completed a form and gave our contact info and continued on to visit family for Christmas. We figured it would arrive later that day or the next day. We kept checking on-line as they had directed us to and our reference number kept saying the luggage was not yet found. So on Christmas Eve, we ran around shopping to get my husband essentials for the first couple of days which included Christmas dinner, etc. After Christmas, we kept checking and the luggage was not found. Now we had to attend a family wedding and then head to the Lakes District for New Year's. This meant that my husband didn't have his suit for the wedding or any of his hiking gear, etc for New Year's. So we bought more stuff. We finished our holiday and flew home to the US without ever getting back his case. We were preparing to submit the claim form to Ryanair for the lost case. The form is quite extensive and you have to include receipts for the lost items. So we had been busy collecting all the info. BUT on January 8th, we received an email that the case had been found and was at London Standsted Airport. We did not at any time fly in or out of that airport. But still, we were happy it was found. So we confirmed items in the case - including my husband's prescription bottle with our name, address and phone number on it. They then said they would ship it to us via a courier. It is now January 17th. To date, our case is still sitting in London. They will not give us any estimate of when we might expect to receive it. They are still waiting for a ""Ryanair Manager to approve the shipment"" to us. This is completely and totally unreasonable treatment. We have now been without the suitcase for 26 days. It was found and confirmed to be ours 10 days ago. But they have done nothing to reunite us with the bag. NOW I believe what everyone says about Ryanair. I had flown other low cost carriers in the past and knew that you needed to make sure you followed all their rules, etc. But as long as you did, they were usually not as bad as all the horror stories you read. But Ryanair deserves every bad review they receive. Not only did they lose the luggage in the first place - they didn't really look all that hard for it as our name, address and phone number were inside all along - and now they are not even trying to do the right thing and return to us in a timely manner. I am beyond disgusted. We travel quite often in Europe as we have family there. We will not ever fly on Ryanair again and I will tell anyone who will listen about our terrible experience."|ryanair
783|"This review is made by my younger brother who doesn't have an yelp account and asked me to post it for him, so here we go!

""I flew from Lisbon to Madrid with a different airline and I didn't have any trouble being checked in. I gave them my passport, and they gave me my ticket. When I went to transfer to the next flight to get my ticket from Ryanair from Madrid to Bucharest (that was when I arrived in Madrid) the front ticketing person wouldn't look me up unless I was checked in. I am 16 years old and for some reason (maybe because I am a minor! Your rules!) it wouldn't let me check in...and I explained that to the person at the ticket counter and she wouldn't care...not even look for my name in the system. Hello! I am here!!! Just look! Than she asked for the reservation number, but I only had one reservation number for both flights (the tickets was bought with a travel agency) and that was the only reference number I had... It is inacceptabile to be so lazy and not to make any effort to solve the situation. I am just a kid lady and company!!! It is your bad rules that you won't allow me to check in online because I am under 18 years old. You just know to give me greave and stress the hack out of me (and first time flying too). Make an effort and do your job...you don't like it?! Go wash restrooms maybe it's easier for you. Ryan air should not give such a hard time to teenagers under 18 years old....helps them and comfort them. You made the rules that I can't check in because I am a minor, than follow he rules and give me a hand. Bad companies never want to improve. RyanAir is one of them. I almost lost my flight but thanks to people around who understood the situation and yelled a couple of time to this brainwashed personnel...I sounds rude but boy I was so stressed out for almost being left behind in a country I don't belong"""|ryanair
784|If Ryanair's €50 fee for checking in at the airport is meant to keep people from crowding their desk at check-in, I suppose it works, because I'll likely never fly Ryanair again.|ryanair
785|I have flown with this airline to a good few destinations, they are handy for those cheap flights and the customer service isn't that bad! Your paying for what you get for. I always bring carry on luggage and never get caught with a longchamp travel bag ( they can't weigh the bags as they use a cardboard rectangle box to see if your carry fit their requirements ). They are strict on your carry on but they will never weigh these bags! Good few destinations but always check what airport your flying into because your transport to your destination could be more than your flight.|ryanair
786|"I just flew home (return) for £40. Seriously. That's less than 50p per kilometer. To wizz through the air at a grand speed and defy the laws of gravity (ish).

Being aware of the rules and fines when flying with Ryanair I had no extra charges or problems. Apart from a jerk business man who thought himself above queues and a 10 minute delay on the tarmac everything went according to plan.

I travel often and mostly alone so never reserve seats and this is never a problem, if I do travel with someone I reserve for an extra few quid. You'll find every now and again the staff *are* lenient with the baggage allowances, I have very clearly brought bags that were too big and too heavy and I have carried carrier bags under a coat on my arm. I've only ever been called out once for a too heavy bag.

Honestly, Ryanair are clear about what they're offering, budget travel with no frills and if you don't play by their rules they will charge you money. Their website is cluttered and packed with extra things you need to constantly click 'no' to. Their staff are not always smiling and sometimes look a bit bored. All airlines will suffer delays and Ryanair are clear with what they offer.

They definitely don't deserve the rating here based on what I've experienced. If you want a better flying experience, pay for it!"|ryanair
787|Ryanair, the company everyone loathes yet can't keep away from.  I myself have mixed feelings about Ryanair.  On the one hand, they do very reasonably priced flights.  On the other you really have to learn their routine as they make their money on the details.  Now that being said like everyone else who has ever flown Ryanair I have a horror story or two about my experiences, but on the other hand I have had some amazing experiences with them as well.  Usually, is all depends on the time of year and who is working.  They are usually very friendly and extremely helpful when you fly out of Ireland.  Other times not so much.  Same on the returns.  I flew to Reus recently and leaving Ireland was brilliant.  My suitcase was a bit over the limit but they said no problem.  Coming back however I was hit with a surcharge.  On top of that due to my passport not being of Irish origin I had to get my ticket stamped coming and going.  Leaving they happily did it while checking in my bag.  On my return from Spain I waited in the queue for two hours only to be told they have a different system there, and was then forced to go queue in another part of the airport for another hour as they do not stamp at the Ryanair desk in the Reus airport like they do in Ireland, a fact that was never mentioned to me anywhere or at anytime.  We also paid for priority boarding and flying over it was perfect, whereas flying back even though we and others had paid for this there was no priority boarding, it was all first come first served and we had to move people out of our pre-booked seats when we did finally make it on the plane. So some good, some bad, but great prices so like everyone else we will complain but of course we will be back.|ryanair
788|"the worst airline ever. my first time and i promise the last time as well.
they didn't let me know the airport check in fee at the time of booking, a fee i've never ever heard of from any other airlines on this planet - i fly on average once every other weeks btw.
i was actually trying to print the boarding pass online in advance without knowing there is a fee by not doing that. however unfortunately, because i was an international traveler, the system didn't allow me to enter the immigration related questions and the online check-in was unsuccessful.
I complained this to the airline employee at the check in counter, and got very rude answers and ended up pay for their fault."|ryanair
789|"There's a reason they are so cheap and it's just not worth it the risk.

1. Apparently online check in is required and if you do not check in online they charge you a RIDICULOUS fee of over $100. I don't understand this policy. First off, for many days while abroad in London I did not have access to wifi. Secondly, even if I had there was no clear indication that this is a policy. I was told it's in the fine print. 2. Front desk personnel at Stansted have a poor concept of customer service. I calmly tried to explain why I was not able to check in prior to arriving at the airport (two hours early mind you) and the front desk woman just became more and more unfriendly. Finally I told her ok go ahead and charge me. While she was typing in my credit card number I just calmly said that I don't agree with this policy because it is not convenient for foreigners and she kept stopping her work to respond to me... so I said please continue to do your work I don't want to miss my flight and she said I have to respond to your question and I said but I am not asking a question I am just expressing my concerns and she said well I have to respond to that and I said well you can respond and work at the same time and she got mad at that and said I refuse to serve you and left her post in a huff. Her co worker had to apologize to me and come and take my credit card. 3. We missed our flight because that was the morning after the Paris shootings and security was extra tight...when we got to the wing of Ryanair it was COMPLETELY EMPTY. Not a soul to help us. It was like a zombie apocalypse. Another girl was there and she found a maintenance man for the airport who told us we have to use a landline and call someone to come pick us up to take us back to the front. We call. We wait. The man drops us off at a midway point. We find a Ryanair desk there and try to book another flight. We are told if we checked bags we have to exit the area completely past security and re enter and oh there's no way back (there is a train to take you from the main terminal) so you have to walk ALL the way back. We get back to the front. Get back on line. We are told because we had bags we have to go to another area, use a special landline and contact someone to bring down our bags. We are told to wait near security for flight personnel. This woman comes down and has us go through security only to just bring us around to baggage claim where our bags are. 4. Finally we are able to rebook new tickets and go through security for the third time but we don't know which train to take for which terminal because they have this policy where you have to wait and watch the board for when the gate is announced and then you only have have like 15 minutes to get there for the boarding window or else you can't fly."|ryanair
790|"If I could give Ryan Air zero stars, I certainly would.  They may be a budget airline, but they're horrible.  Even on a budget airline I expect to be treated like a human being.  

My brother and I flew Ryan Air from Edinburgh to Dublin.  Unfortunately, our travel agent didn't tell us about Ryan Air's policy that you must check in online 24 hours in advance; in addition to the original price of the ticket, we were each charged another £70 (about $110) just to board the plane.  Then, because my brother had a heavy bag, he was charged an additional £280(!) to check the bag.  What are you going to do when you're already there and need to board the flight?  In addition, we had to go back through the check-in line three times as they don't take any money at the counter and they insisted on charging us each additional fee separately.  After all that nonsense our flight was delayed more than an hour with no explanation.  About 15 minutes of that hour we were all packed on a hot, stinky bus waiting to board the plane.  It was miserable.

A number of other people on the flight were also charged alst-minute additional baggage fees for having carry-ons and a purse, as you can only have one bag.  Ryan Air stinks though -- no one considers a small purse a bag and every other airline allows two carry-ons.

The staff is horrible, mean, and miserable.  The planes themselves are cheaply built and tiny, and there is limited reserved seating.  

Do yourself a favor and don't fly Ryan Air.  You'd be better off trying to swim between Ireland and Scotland -- it would probably be cheaper and less painful."|ryanair
791|"AVOID these scammers. They are in no way compared to Southwest Airlines (which some try to claim).  They fail to inform you of important things that will cost you a ton of money at the worst time (when you're ready to board the plane).

BOARDING PASSES - Print them ahead of time, or you pay about $58 at the airport, just to get the pass. This happens even if you checked in ahead of time. There's no clear information when you check in online to let you know they'll slam you with this fee. AND - when you pay the fee, you don't actually get the boarding pass - you get a piece of paper to take to the ticket counter, and it's printed there.  

LUGGAGE WEIGHT - they charge heavily for anything over 33 pounds - they weigh in kilos, and 15 kilos (33 lbs) is the cutoff. After that, it's 10 euro for every kilo over the limit. My friend paid about $78 extra for a bag that would have been fine under USA guidelines of 50 pounds. She paid that in addition to the already hefty baggage fee.

The seats are uncomfortable, way too close together and there's very little leg room. There's no such thing as a complimentary soft drink, or even water. They charge for EVERYTHING. They also go up and down the aisles trying to sell merchandize and lottery tickets. The entire experience was miserable - I will never fly on this airline again."|ryanair
792|Worst airline ever!!!! Between the awful experience at beauvais airport the flight attendants peddling scratch offs and the pilot almost killing....|ryanair
793|Honestly I'm so disappointed and frustrated with this airline. €45 to check in??? Are you kidding me?? I've never in my life had to pay to check in, not even in LA and that says something. First and absolute last time I'll use this airline to go anywhere. We had no warning no one told us anything and then to make us pay just to check in. Screw that. Never recommending anyone to use this airline because they screw you over. I WISH I COULD GIVE -100 STARS!!!|ryanair
794|"I am sorry to add my voice to the chorus of disappointment echoing 'round Ryanair - and I didn't even get off the ground!  The company's website is so messed up that it mistakenly inputs basic passenger info - don't save your credit card with this outfit! - and then defies every attempt at correction.  What they call customer service is of no help, and the only response I ever received to repeated efforts to contact the airline resulted only in my complaints being regurgitated to me, with a ""canned"" solution that solved nothing.  After a month of trying to fix things - and all this after the company's much-trumpeted ""customer service 'outreach'"" earlier this Spring - I gave up and took the easy way out ... as in easyjet.  You had your chance, Ryanair, and you blew it.  Take my advice, fly elsewhere, and save yourself A LOT of grief and wasted time!"|ryanair
795|"People hear the name Ryanair and they already have an opinion of the airline formed.

I have been flying Ryanair regularly for three years now and I really find their service great. OK, I admit at the start I have been caught out a few times by their terms, conditions and charges. But once we started using Ryanair within the parameters they set, its been fine. Delays are infrequent, I usually can't remember when the last delay was.

I find most Ryanair staff very nice and helpful. The in-flight service of sell, sell, sell is irritating but this is how they make money and it keep prices low. I am more than happy to put up with it.

What makes me laugh at the airport when I arrive at the departure gate are the people who pay for priority boarding and still queue when everyone else does. They are paying for the privilege to queue... genius."|ryanair
796|I have to give Ryanair 4 stars because it allows me to travel over to my best mate for around 50 quid. As long as you play by their rules it all works out quite well. Their landing leaves a lot to be desired and think I nearly got a bit if whiplash last time but thumbs up for low fairs.|ryanair
797|The worlds greatest airline. Have we all forgotten how our national carrier (now sold to foreigners!) used to rip us off before Ryanair. Without Ryanair there would be no fun trips to far off places just because ! They don't mislead you - you get what you pay for and that's alright by me. Thank you team Ryanair and Michael O'Leary for building one of the worlds largest airlines out of our small North Atlantic island !!!|ryanair
798|Had a horrible experience. They booked me for the wrong flight and wouldn't change it. Never responded to my emails. Terrible customer service. Definitely will go with any other air lines next time. Save yourself the hassle and pay more for a reliable airlines.|ryanair
799|"Ryanair is the basics airline. The bare essentials!

Ran by the infamous Michael O'Leary ""You get what you pay for"". Hated by other airlines for driving down the prices in the lucrative airline market and scorned by the public for the lack of customer service Ryanair is the no frills attached airline that gets you from A to B. Despised as it may be by most Ryanair is the largest airline in Europe it does this for the low prices it offers to customers.

Being a student watching his pennies I have frequented Ryanair a few times in the past and I must say I can't complain. Yes one could protest over the lack of leg space, often further away departure gates and even airports but overall it serves its purpose of delivering a budget travel alternative. I can't rave over a deep gratitude for this low cost alternative as it's not always the lower cost option but maintains the no frills constant however overall it tends to be the cheaper airline.

Don't expect much travelling Ryanair and you'll be happy when you realise you don't have to put coins into the toilets aboard or your bags winding up ""lost"" somehow as most people I've spoken to have one or another horror story over the traumatic ""ordeal"" of buying tickets with such a travesty of an airline.

Basically in summation, it's not that bad, it's fine!"|ryanair
800|Got a chance to travel with Singapore Airlines to travel and back from San Francisco. The staff were very friendly, I had to undergo an issue with my itinerary, they solved it smoothly over few hours and ensured a safe and enjoyable travel.|singapore-airlines
801|"Most people wouldn't say that they relish a 15 or even 17 hour-long flight. Unless it's with Singapore Airlines.

SIA has a well-deserved reputation as one of the world's best airlines, and the experience here at SFO lives up to it. Check-in is reasonably fast, uncrowded, and pleasant, helped by the fact that they serve only two destinations from here: HKG and SIN.

The boarding process can feel a bit chaotic, but this is more a function of the gate area layouts here in the International Terminal than of SIA itself. Even then, when I boarded here, they used one of the end gates here at Concourse G, where there is a wider, more spacious feeling to the boarding area (not to mention more seating!) than the ""side"" gates.

If you have the luxury of a business or first-class ticket, then, needless to say, you know you've got quite a treat ahead of you on board the plane. Huge gourmet meals (case in point: there was a special turkey dinner for Christmas recently), an encyclopedic entertainment library, super-comfortable and roomy lie-flat seats, and perhaps the most diligent and professional service in the skies.

I had the misfortune of sitting behind a super high-maintenance dude in 11A who *had* to order everything on the menu and take *flash* pictures of it all. The entire cabin started lighting up as if it were a fashion runway, modeling studio, or lightning storm. He also befriended someone in first class who joined him in 11A (yes, the seats are *that* spacious) for an hours-long conversation. The fact that the dude in 11A had a super squeaky, whiny, high-pitched voice didn't help either.

Since the flight had taken off at midnight San Francisco time, folks around him (not just me) were trying to get in some sleep. By this point, it was 3.30am San Francisco time. I'd already finished my Christmas turkey dinner. I'd already rewatched ""Lost in Translation"" in its entirety. I'd even finished reading the day's Chronicle, New York Times, and Financial Times. Yet Squeaky Whiny Super High-Maintenance Dude was STILL yakking away. Yak yak yak yak yak yak yak yak. He just wouldn't shut up!

So I'd had enough. I raised a stink to the cabin staff, who very, very graciously granted my request: to be reseated to a quieter part of the cabin. They even helped me move my baggage, personal items, and drinks. Problem solved. Squeaky Whiny Super High-Maintenance Dude got even more space to hold his royal court with his new boyfriend, while I quickly settled in for a blissful, cozy, uninterrupted 8-hour-long sleep.

Heck, if it wasn't a midnight flight and if I hadn't been up all day, maybe I would have joined Squeaky Whiny Super High-Maintenance Dude in 11A and his much more pleasant-sounding, agreeable, and handsome friend from first class in their mutual admiration society, but I have standards to uphold with respect to the former, and the stars weren't aligned with the latter. And I just needed my sleep. Thankfully, the SIA cabin crew were able to resolve the situation in a way that worked out for everyone."|singapore-airlines
802|"I'll preface this review by saying I'm a total aviation geek and almost love my flights as much as the destination. That said, I'd always wanted to fly Singapore business class because I'd heard such great things from friends who had experienced the service. So, in a recent trip to Tokyo, Japan I figured why the heck not.

It was brilliant. From the level of service to the food to the seat it was all top notch. I mean, take a look at the photos and you'll see the expansive space. It's like your own 6x6 pod complete with all the amenities. Sure, it's expensive but if you're an airplane geek like me it's worth every penny.

If you find yourself flying Singapore you'll be impressed."|singapore-airlines
803|"This review is for Singapore Airlines Economy Class. I have flown them once in the past and both times were excellent from the check in, to boarding, to free headphones, free on board entertainment (movies, tv shows, music, etc) and surprisingly, pretty decent airplane food! My trip was to Bali, Indonesia and I flew Singapore from SFO to HK. From HK to Singapore and from Singapore to Bali. So 3 planes there and 3 planes back. Their customer service is wonderful, warm, friendly with the most prettiest ladies serving you ;)

Every flight you board, they come around with a warm hot towel for you to clean your hands, face and neck with. They also come around with an Economy class menu which shows you the drinks, set menus for the flight and snack options in between. I paid a bit more for extra leg room for the stretch from SFO to HK and from HK back to SFO, which was worth it in case you're wondering if you should splurge to be a little more comfortable. I took advantage of the newest movies..Alita Battle Angel, Captain Marvel, Nancy Drew, and some old Disney Movies and Sleepless In Seattle (hey, I was craving romantic comedy ok!). The flight attendants come around with drinks first, the serve your meals, snacks in between and another meal before you depart. Lots to eat/drink! They don't skimp or leave you hungry!

One thing I noticed that they did several years ago which they have stopped doing was to pass out a Singapore Airlines toiletry bag which includes comb, socks, toothbrush/toothpaste and eye mask. In the Economy Class menu, it shows that you can now request these items if you need it but they don't pass them out anymore. If you need toothbrush/toothpaste, they are located inside the restroom drawer as well.

Flight attendants are busy but on 2 of the flights, the attendants forgot my drink. One came back for it later and one completely forgot. So FYI- for improvements and feedback wise, pay attention to your passengers drinks! Also, the flight from Singapore back to HK, my seat was very stained. I do not know how often seat cleanliness are inspected but I would definitely improve on that.

Overall, I would continue to fly Singapore Airlines both for their service, safety records and again the pretty ladies are a plus! It is no wonder it is the best even for Economy Class."|singapore-airlines
804|"Singapore Airlines is my airline of choice for long-haul flights to Asia. Being Skytrax's Airline of the Year is one fancy recognition to beat!

Check-in at SFO was immediate with no line for Business Class. In fact, the First Class agent checked me into my flight, went over my pre-selected meals via Book the Cook, and came out behind the podium to direct me to the security checkpoint.

TSA PreCheck security was also a breeze taking less than 5 minutes.

Despite being on a 13-year-old plane, the plane itself was in tip-top shape, very clean and modern. 30 MB of Wifi was complimentary and it was $23.99 for 500 MB of Wifi for the next 15 hours. Wifi was decent, considering it was satellite!

Service throughout the flight was world class. Cabin crew greeted me by name and offered me a pre-flight beverage before take off. As soon as we were into the skies, I was offered another beverage and warm nuts.

Dinner service was spectacular with a white table cloth service and each course was presented ever so tactfully by the Singapore Girl. Ordered the Crab Cake via Book the Cook and they were quite tasty! ...the potatoes weren't fully cooked yet though!

The highlight of the flight was sleeping for a full 8 hours! The seat flips down into a bed and I got a full 8 hours sleep with a Tom Yam Noodles w/ Prawns and Vegetables as a midnight snack!

I was awoken by the cabin crew greeting me good morning and offering me a hot towel prior to breakfast service. Although no amenity kits are provided for Business class passengers, the drawers inside the bathroom have plenty of combs, toothbrushes etc.

The Roast Duck over yellow noodles was a delectable meal prior to landing!"|singapore-airlines
805|"Yelp, please move the Singapore Airlines that is erroneously based in Houston, TX, back to SFO! :/

Flew Singapore Airlines Business Cabin to Hong Kong the other night and it was a decent experience.

Dedicated Business Class check-in was quick as there was no one upon arrival. For those without TSA Pre-Check, Singapore Airlines offers premium cabin security check. For those with TSA Pre-Check, Singapore Airlines now integrates with the TSA for a seamless experience!

As KrisFlyer at SFO is permanently closed, the lounge experience was horrendous at United Club...

Boarding was easy via the dedicated Premium Cabin door. The 777-300 ER into HKG is an older Business Class hard product that converts the seat into a hard sleeping surface into the corner. All Business cabin seats have direct aisle access and feature either a window (for single travelers) or two middle seats (for couples).

Despite being on-board an aircraft with Wifi, Wifi was not available for the duration of the flight.

Full dinner service was available shortly after take off. Leveraged Book The Cook with the braised short ribs and what came out was a Korean short-ribs with JapChae and plain rice. ...this was lackluster at best. Rice was dry and the japchae was also on the dry side. The beef ribs weren't that tasty.

The breakfast before the touchdown was also lackluster with someone stale dim sum (...rather surprising for a Business Cabin).

The highlight of the flight was the super cordial cabin crew that made the flight enjoyable. ...all of the cabin attendants knew my name and called me by name throughout the flight...

Restrooms were always available and spotless!"|singapore-airlines
806|"Flew on SQ1 9V-SWT Boeing 777-300 ER into HKG the other night.  With the flight taking off at 1:15 am...it definitely makes for a long night.

Check-in by generic ground grew was courteous and swift. The boarding process was also efficient based upon seat assignment.

The aircraft, although 10 years old, was in good condition with new carpet, new seat cushions and the state-of-the-art 10.6"" AVOD screen!

Food used to be even better on SQ. This time, food was still edible, still night and day compared to domestic carriers.

The cabin crew is talented which makes the journey that much more enjoyable."|singapore-airlines
807|"Asian airlines are night and day when compared with the domestic carriers. Standard on Asian airlines include: brand new and clean planes, beautiful and young flight attendants, along with superb and attentive service.

The food on Asian airlines is always FREE, along with your baggage. Smiles are standard too!

During my entire journey, there was always plenty of food available, in case I was hungry.

...the flight attendants will take away your empty cups and turn off your reading lights if they see you sleeping!"|singapore-airlines
808|"I am currently adding review only to help people trying to cancel the ticket during this corona virus time.

For customer service please contact:
+1 (800)-742-3333

Enter your Kris Flyer number and the passcode and patiently wait to get connected to customer service. They have huge call volume so we need to be waiting for long time Approx 1:56mins my case.

Note: After 1Hr and 11 mins the music will stop that doesn't mean the call got disconnected. We need to keep the call ON until we get connected.

Initially i thought the call got disconnected and i hung the call but today morning i left it even after the ""Call HOLD"" music stops. Was lucky.

Hope this helps some folks around looking for solution.

Overall i like Singapore airlines and i will post one more review in detail about the customer service experience."|singapore-airlines
809|The service for SA has slipped over the years. I flew Premium Economy to Singapore recently. Food was subpar.  From Houston to Manchester, the flight attendant spilled water on me, missing utensils, and food tray has spilled water on it. From Manchester to Singapore, same incident. Apparently there is a flaw on the seat table. When she placed the water on the table, it began to slide down and spill all over me. Again, incomplete silverwares when serving food. On my way back, the flight attendant spilled drinks on me twice!!! She forgot to bring us our drinks. Bathrooms were unkempt. I suspect SA services have slipped because they have rested on one's laurels too long.|singapore-airlines
810|"Voted the best airline for several years running. I had some high expectations and they were met for the most part. Checking in was a little strange because I had read online that I'd be able to check in and then go to a kiosk to verify my passport. But no, I had to check in at the counter to get our boarding passes. No big deal.
We were early so we hung out at the Centurion Lounge. Never again. Free stuff isn't worth the aggravation.
We finally were able to board and we had premium economy at the bulkhead. 31A and 31C. This gave us a lot of leg room which I was thankful for. We had used Book The Cook to preorder our food so that we would not have to take whatever was left over if we were served last. They have two meal services on this flight since the SFO-SIN is around 16 hours. The food was good but every time we ordered whiskey , they had to write it down and have someone bring it to us, which I found so strange, since we were asking it from the lady with the beverage cart who was right in front of us.
Is is a ploy to give out less alcohol? Maybe.
The seat itself has an odd configuration that maybe wasn't meant for a person over 6 feet but there was a foot rest that swung down and then kinda jammed up my legs so I couldn't stretch them out fully.  The attendants were friendly enough. We had MANY babies on this flight.
Please, do yourselves a favor. Buy some Bose noise canceling over the ear headphones. This was the best thing I've ever bought to fly anywhere. So I couldn't hear the shrieking babies for the majority of the flight.
The entertainment was fine. I was never able to connect to the WiFi which was no big deal as I had downloaded a bunch of stuff from Amazon to watch.
I'd fly them again."|singapore-airlines
811|"Over the last 40 plus years I have flown Singapore Airlines many, many times from West Coast, USA and, also, regionally while living in S'pore for 7 years.

Due to the generosity of my employer it was always first class. And it was First Class all the way. It was always a treat to fly w/ the best. The lessons the U.S. carriers (buses w/ wings) could learn from this airline!

I do not recall ever having had even the slightest issue. I applaud the men and women of Singapore Airlines.  SIA is not inexpensive, but they are excellent (as they say, ""You get what you pay for"").

Give them a try!!! I don't think you will regret your decision unless you are  an uber particular person and then, even at that, I think you will agree no one even comes close to SIA."|singapore-airlines
812|"Other than I wish they had the ability of teleporting me across the globe, I can't think of anything negative to say about this airline; professional, welcoming, warm, fast, and courteous. The entire staff made the long ass flight as comfortable as possible.

One suggestion: soundproof room for crying asshole kids.

The food options were great; dumplings, eggs, roasted potatoes, noodles, Magnum bar ice cream, cheesecake, salads, etc. (American, Chinese, and Indian). Plenty of in between things to snack on if you wish (chips, cookies, candies, bars, etc.). Alcoholic drinks are free - I do not drink so I did not care about this option.

Warm towels after you are seated? Wow. I loved it.

A pillow and blanket is on every seat. You get access to new movies (some not out on DVD yet), shows, and games. I watched a lot of Disney movies (Toy Story 1, Toy Story 2, Toy Story 3, Ratatouille, Tangled, Good Dinosaur) amongst others. BTW, Everest is a great documentary.

Will fly w/ them in a few months. I go back to Singapore in July."|singapore-airlines
813|They always take good care of me - awesome airline that goes above and beyond to make you feel comfortable- I am planning a trip back to Singapore  and will definitely be using them! First class with them is the best!!! They are amazing good food and great service!!! Highly recommend!|singapore-airlines
814|Poor food quality (Chef stuff-cold multiple times), aging aircraft interiors, insincere flight attendants, quirky check in (weighing a backpack,,,really?), below par flight management (ticketing and gate notification). Sorry to say any domestic carrier exceeds them without the fake smiles.|singapore-airlines
815|"this was my first trip with singapore airlines but for long flights in the future i would always prefer to fly with Singapore airlines.

Service, flight attendants, food, drinks, entertainment, roomy seats, cleaniness, and check in are absolutely outstanding.

I have been using American Airlines and United Airlines for my business and personal trips but in comparison to Singapore Airlines the total experience that Singapore Airlines provides to customers is outstanding. Other airlines should learn from Singapore airlines as a role model airline."|singapore-airlines
816|"Be careful booking flights with a U.S. credit card for friends/family overseas!

I purchased a Singapore Airlines ticket with a U.S. credit card for my sister in law in Taipei.  The website stated:

""Please be reminded that the cardholder is required to present the credit/debit card for verification in person at ANY Singapore Airlines ticketing office ...""

I live close to the San Francisco airport and thought this would be easy.

Now, Singapore Airlines has changed the rules but they did not update their system.  You need to show the credit card in person when checking in.  In this case at the Taipei airport.  Obviously, this is not possible for me.

Trying to cancel the ticket.  Singapore Airlines U.S. customer service is telling me to call their Taipei office.  This is crazy!
_______________________________________________________________

Update:  I did call their Taiwan office and they were very helpful. All I had to do is fill out a form.

So, happy with their Taiwan office but still very frustrated with Singapore Airlines U.S. customer service for giving me the wrong information - twice."|singapore-airlines
817|"For our first ever together international trip, I didn't want to get stuck with some bogus airline. Thankfully I completely lucked into scoring a major deal on Singapore Airlines for our trip to Bangkok.

From the moment we arrived at the check-in counter, I noticed something was different from domestic carriers. A genuine smile! Not only did she check us and our (FREE!) luggage in, she went the extra mile of giving us a map and explaining which terminal our connection in Singapore would most likely be at.

The Boeing 777-300 that we flew on the most important 13+ hour leg of our first stop in Hong Kong is probably the best flight experience I've ever had, despite its length. The 11"" touchscreen monitor with games, TV shows, and movies on demand, totally ruined my plans of catching up with Yelp reviews during the flight. With some of the latest DVD releases available, I caught up with 4 movies that I had yet to see instead.

I love that even even though you are in economy class, they treat you as if you were flying first class. Decent (even Vegan) meals, hot towels, free booze (yes FREE!) and more! I can't imagine the level of service the next few classes up. They were almost too attentive. They kept waking us up every few hours with food or drinks. There is a do not disturb option on your in seat monitor if you wish to use it.

It doesn't hurt that the flight attendants all look like beauty pageant contestants. That's probably because they basically are. Heck even the dudes are pretty. Just remember blue dress will be very pretty and could be a total n00b. Green dress, most likely pretty but has much more experience. Red dress, most likely not pretty but has the most experience. The same with the guys and their ties.

Next time I fly any direction that Singapore serves I hope I am able to utilize their amazing service again."|singapore-airlines
818|"I booked a flight from IAH to SIN with Singapore Airlines about 6 weeks in advance. To my surprise, I was not able to select a seat until 48 hours before departure. So I called the office to make a request. Initially they confirmed a central aisle seat for me which I was very happy about. Then a few weeks later, I was displaced by an unknown reason. I had to call the office again. Eventually they put me on the window aisle seat after online check-in.

One thing I never understand is why someone pays for a non basic economy ticket 6 weeks in advance is unable to select a seat?"|singapore-airlines
819|"I have flown Singapore Airlines from the past 20 years regularly to India from SFO. They used to care about customers before; apparently, being named the best airline in the world has gone to their head and they think they no longer have to satisfy their customers.
I flew Premium economy recently to Bangalore--the flight was ordinary. I was expecting an offer to business class before my flight (like Emirates and even China airlines offers) and I have more than 50,000 pts. Nothing came--when I tried to offer a bid, the system didn't allow me to. When I saw, there were plenty of seats empty in Business class and they don't want to offer the premium economy passengers to upgrade.

Warning to everyone travelling from SFO--some connections to India have a very short layover --less than an hour. SA doesn't have any consideration that if the landing is a few minutes late and the connecting flight is within 30 minutes, they shouldn't make the passenger run from one terminal to another even using Skytrain. Remember, you have to go through security in Singapore when you have a connecting flight. I had to rush from Terminal B to C.  

While returning from Bangalore, I had ~4 kgs extra. Instead of asking me to pay using my points, Singapore airlines charge me for a whole piece. So watch out, even if you are just 3- 4 kgs over the limit, they will charge the cost of a whole suitacase. This is another example of not caring for customers. They can charge per Kg weight instead of an additional piece of luggage. Not allowing me to pay extra baggage with my points --no consideration if you are Kris flyer member with 1000s points, they just don't care.
Flight and food was ordinary (food quality has declined from SF to Singapore)  and the bathroom cleanliness while going and coming was not upto par like it used to be. Changi airport is exceptional of course.

I am not sure I will  be flying this airline again while there are so many carriers who offer upgrades for reasonable price, cheaper tickets. Not sure what to do with more than 50,000 points though."|singapore-airlines
820|Do NOT FLY WITH THESE PEOPLE!!!  Economy seats pack you in like rats, then the person in front of you can lean their chair all the way back so you have to fly across the Pacific with a stranger in your lap. I requested a lactose free meal. It was Absolutely disgusting and inedible, it made me sick. Lastly, dreading the flight home I had to get my board pass at the counter the woman forced me to check in my bag because it was not 7 kg. This was the same carry on bag and contents I had flown in with. THE EXACT SAME BAG WITH CONTENTS, and suddenly it was a problem. Spend more money and fly with a reputable brand. These 3rd world airlines are horrible.|singapore-airlines
821|Awful service. I needed a transit visa for a 1.5 hours layover in Hong Kong. It wasn't flagged when I booked the ticket. I called the contact center later to inquire about visas.. no one gave me this information. Btw employees in contact center are really ill informed and not helpful at all. Then i was turned back from the airport because they couldn't rebook me. Then I tried calling the contact center for a transfer and honestly the lady was rude and unhelpful.  They didn't transfer me. I had to rebook me with 1300 dollars. Also the most unhelpful customer service.|singapore-airlines
822|"This is my worst experience with this airlines. I was traveling international through this they canceled my flight and did not informed me

823|"I finally used up all my miles on UA and decided I am going to try another airline flying overseas.  This was my first time on Singapore Airlines and I really liked it.  For once, each seat has their own tv monitor, although the last I flew overseas, I was on a UA Dreamliner and there was tv monitor at each seat.

Based on my past experiences with UA, I was prepared for a long and boring journey and didn't know what to expect from SA.  I brought magazines, iPad, neck pillow, blanket, water bottle, all kinds of snacks, noise cancelling headphones and anything you can think of to be comfortable on a tiny seat but I was totally impressed by what SA has to offered.  Long story short, I watched three movies, slept a little, ate all the plane food and arrived to my destination safe and sound!

Next time I will definitely ask for a cup o noodle for snack!"|singapore-airlines
824|"Didn't quite live up to expectations given their reputation.

I've been wanting to fly on Singapore Airlines in Business Class for years. I had heard such great things about their service. So when I finally got the chance, I guess my expectations were set pretty high.

The business seats on the new 777's are really nice. No inside seats and having to climb over people like you do in United Business. The entertainment system is modern with a large monitor and separate touch screen color remote that uses swipe gestures. The back of the seat flips over to create the bed, but there is no separate mattress like Air New Zealand and while it is much better than the United reclining seat, the bed is not as comfortable as Air New Zealand. I also just love the Air New Zealand Business seating layout, where you get a little guest chair in case you have a visitor.

The food quality was good, but for my palate, too large and a little boring. The food is not really restaurant class. Virgin America, even though it is only a domestic carrier does much more interesting restaurant class food. One of the best Mushroom and truffle oil omeletes I've ever had was on a Virgin America short flight from San Diego to San Francisco.

The service was efficient, but a little aloof. Not at all what I had expected given the hype. For example converting the seat to a bed is not an obvious process, but the Singapore flight attendants leave you to figure this out your self. Air New Zealand does a much better job of  making a big deal of making up your bed with a fresh matress and comforter for you.

In summary I loved the Singapore airlines seats and entertainment system, but was disappointed in the food and service. For the SFO-HKG route I thought Cathay Pacific was a little better. For overall international service I am now a total Air New Zealand fan."|singapore-airlines
825|I was on flight 012 from Mumbai to Singapore and than on to Los Angeles . In Mumbai a man got on in shorts and sat down , took his shoes off no socks and proceeded to fondle himself, I was in the aisle seat G35 on October 30th  and had paid 1300 extra round trip for ecomony plus. I was moved to a middle seat, and he wasn't talked too.I was told there weren't anymore aisle seats. The only reason I paid the extra money was also to have an aisle seat plus the leg room.  He should have been moved not me. The staff never talked to me after moving me.He was the one who was disgusting, infact I think it might be harassment in todays climate. I was absolutely horrified and still think about why I had to be subjected to the treatment I received like I was the guilty one.|singapore-airlines
826|"I was unable to get the quote I needed on the website so I called. I spoke with 2 people on 2 calls. It was difficult to understand their English at times. The first one slurred her words especially. The interaction was so frustrating I gave up.

The second one was slightly better, but she didn't know airport codes and asked me if I knew the codes for the airports I wanted; she told me several times that I must be on a travel agent website because the itinerary I wanted wasn't possible on their system. The airline system quoted the city I asked her for, but she said it wasn't possible. When I confirmed the website address for her airline was the one I was on she suggested I use a travel agent website to book the flights."|singapore-airlines
827|"Again their PHONE customer service is bad. These people from the Philippines. They do not know the rules of SQ and just randomly answered your questions.

Today I went on line and they quote me only $140 for Oversize baggage one trip. OMG... SQ you better TRAIN WELL this people from the Philippines.

829|"""Singapore girl, you're a great way to fly!""

Who wouldn't want to be pampered by beautiful women on board as you wake up, and be provided with warm smiles that says, ""Sir, please put your chair in the up right position, pull your tray table out in front of you, and prepare for a fantastic meal!"" That alone, will put you in dreamland!  Did you also noticed how they all smell so good? LMAO.

I have had my share through the years of flying with the Singapore Girls!  Service have always been consistently fantastic, and as years went on, they just get better with age.  It's like fine wine, EXCELLENT!

I have flown on board with their 747, 777 as well as their AirBus 380. I have also flown from Hong Kong to other parts of Asia with their smaller aircrafts.  One of the highlights of my trips through the years with Singapore Airlines were their food on board.  They were always delicious and piping hot.

While there are many choices of airlines to choose from when flying international, for the past 15 years and going, I choose to fly Singapore Airlines for their superior customer service.  Now that, is worth reviewing about!

Until then, Cheers! :p"|singapore-airlines
830|I've been told that this is one of the better airlines to Asia because the seats are wider. I've been on China Airline and Eva airline before. I like Eva and Singapore. China Airline seats are way too narrow. The food on Singapore Airline is also pretty good, stewardess are also very nice. Highly recommended if you can get a ticket with them... even a flight attendant from Eva has told me really good things about Singapore Airline!|singapore-airlines
831|A few days ago I lost my passport upon arrival in SFO. The staff were very helpful in taking care of this issue. I was assisted by Jeffrey and I was pleased by the efficiency of Singapore Airlines. Great service, thank you!|singapore-airlines
832|Good airline. I can't imagine why they get 1 star from some people.. may be they all too picky....  My freight need a emergency landing at Tokyo as a person get sick during freight.  Even the cruise is a little bit confused .. But they do there best on freight|singapore-airlines
833|"We made a connection from SFO to Narita via United; then took flight SQ633 from Haneda Tokyo international airport to Singapore.  

What a difference.  After 7 1/2 hours on United with overworked and over the hill flight attendants who thought they were doing you a favor, what a delight to fly Singapore Airlines for 6 1/2 hours.

The flight attendants can't do enough to ensure you're taken care of. So polite and so helpful.  The cabin itself seems refreshing and clean as with the lavatories.  

In their sarongs and their hair pulled back into tight buns, and the right amount of makeup, it made for a great flight.  And the airplane itself was roomier, even in economy class where we were.

It was pure delight."|singapore-airlines
834|"I dont know what to say. It seems I got trapped by airlines who do business judging people's mindset. I was tracking to book an international ticket to VTZ, India for more than 2 months. Suddenly they put 'only few tickets left' and then I acted fast and bought my ticket for 1500$ (where as other carriers are offering for atleast 200$ less). Suddenly after 2 days, I can see a price drop of 200$ for the same ticket I bought. I was shocked, reached the airlines and they said cancellation and refund costs me 200$ even I tried cancelling before 48hrs of booking.

I think not to buy tickets in SG anymore. Even having tickets for other nearest destinations in other carriers for 900-1000$, my inclination towards SG airlines has burned my pocket."|singapore-airlines
835|"There are two sides to Singapore Airlines: Aircraft and online/phone service. Their aircraft service is hands down one of the best. Their online and phone service is absolutely horrific. I made a redemption booking earlier this year and when I called, I had to endure this process:

1. Wait for 15 minutes for the initial help
2. Wait 30 minutes to be transferred to the redemption department (not to be disrespectful, but they do not speak English well)
3. Told that I needed to speak with the Frankfurt office
4. Would not transfer me to the Frankfurt office
5. I called the Frankfurt office and they were closed.

Online, you cannot make changes to your redemption booking. For an airline that has such great in-plane service, their support via internet and phone is ABYSMAL."|singapore-airlines

Side note: Incompency, I guess is an excuse for not getting my bag.  It's ok for the airliner to lose my bag.  That's sort of wierd.

I spoke to two Singapore Airline representatives and told them that I can even get a recommendation letter from my vet that my dogs are healthy for travel. However, both representatives stated that they changed their policy on June 1, 2016. I ended up cancelling my flight and took a loss because Singapore Airlines wouldn't accomdate my request given that their website provides false/misleading information.

I was able to select my seats free of charge with  united &  Ana partner airlines on my itinerary but not with SIA. Based on this experience, I will skip SIA flight in the future and there goes one less customer on SIA  flight and more empty seats on your flight. Not a smart move for SIA.|singapore-airlines

And flight attendants were amazing. They took their time to hold our baby boy when he was a little fussy, got to know them by name and they us. The food was delicious for a flight, hot and ready, alcohol selection was great, beer and wine. Snacks, blankets, and other great services! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this airline to everyone.|singapore-airlines

I booked a flight for my father but selected the wrong departure date (like a dumb dumb). I called their customer service line within 10 minutes of booking the flight to change to the correct departure date. No big deal right? Well it is according to Singapore Airlines. After speaking with 3 different supervisors over the course of 45 minutes they informed me that I had no ability to change the ticket and I can cancel the ticket, be refunded 1/3 of the original ticket value, and re-book for the correct dates. This would put me in the hole over $500 bucks. Every response that I received from their reps was cold and scripted.

Flights may be nice, but their customer service makes them a big loser."|singapore-airlines
843|"Every time I fly back to Hong Kong, Singapore Airlines is my preferred airline of choice because of a few reasons:

1) Their airplanes are spacious - Yes, even in Economy class. The seats lounge back more than the other airlines do and there is a lot of leg space (trust me I know, I'm 6 feet tall in an Asian airline). Also, the restrooms are spacious, unlike Cathay Pacific, where I literally have to squat a little just to pee (tmi, I know).
2) Their food is actually good - Do take this with a grain of salt as I am one of the few weirdos that actually like airplane food.
3) Friendly flight attendants - I've sat next to a difficult traveler once and the flight attendant that was assisting this difficult person never flinched nor showed frustration not once! They always walk around the plane with a smile on their faces, which is nice when you're stuck immobile for 14 hours at a time (depending on where you fly to).
4) Every seat has their own television sets and they've actually got a decent variety of movies to choose from. Whether it's from Hollywood to Bollywood!"|singapore-airlines

At the airport during check in yesterday, the staff required that the card holder show the card as proof. This is an outdated policy since fraud rates are next to none for airlines in the US. My grandparents were stressed and called me desperately for help.

I called the SG air manager at SFO; he was rude, made excuses, and hung up on me. In the end, I had to drive to the airport which used several hours of my time. Any common sense airport manager would have found a creative solution: such as my grandpa showing a photo of the card on his phone, or allowing 2 elderly folks to pass using common sense. The email confirmation I received mention NOWHERE that the traveler had to bring any credit card, and the fine print was misleading."|singapore-airlines

846|"Probably one of the best flight experiences to date for me. Friendly staff, clean plane, and lots of food. All the makings of a 5 star experience...

The reason why this airline didn't get a 5 star:

While at the Singapore airport, two middle eastern looking men were trying to get thru security. The Singapore Airline staffer at the counter immediately told them their European sized carry-on was too big and they'd have to buy another seat to strap in their suitcase. He was rude, yelling at the customers and making a huge scene!! He then proceeded to tell them the flight was full and that they'd have to wait until the following day to fly!! This was a red eye flight! (SQ Flight 608 from SIN to ICN on May 30, 2015.

I think the situation could have been better handled. The Singapore Airline staffer could have been more calm. He should have offered to check in the bags. The whole situation could have been SO less dramatic! Instead, all passengers of Gate B9 heard and saw the incidence! This was very unprofessional and made us very uncomfortable!

If I was in this situation, I would not have passively let the staffer yell at me or embarrass me like this. It would have been a big, ugly shouting match and I would definitely file a complaint against Singapore Airlines. And to make matters even more bitter for me, there plenty of empty overhead bin space on that flight!!

But I don't want one ugly incident with one bad staffer ruining the entire airline's reputation. Many other people worked very hard to provide a pleasant experience."|singapore-airlines
847|"I am going to go ahead and give these guys a 1 star review.
The customer service on the flight was top notch and the seats were very comfortable. The in flight experience was great. On my flight from Singapore to Tokyo they were just slanging drinks the whole time. So much so that i had to cut myself off because i didnt want to get trashed on a 7 hour flight. best piece of advice is to get a window seat on the long hauls flights. Its soo much easier to sleep for hours on end that way. I had a 14 hour, 3 hour, 7 hour, and 10 hour flights with them. Then a 1 hour flight on Virgin.

The one star is for their policies which are unbelievably atrocious.

I had a flight booked for a Monday but due to a ""Super Typhoon"" that is set to hit Japan I wanted to fly back home before. Makes sense right? Wait to be stuck in Japan and miss work...or get home safely before the storm hits. 4 hour and 3 days of time they kept telling me that they could not move my flight from Tokyo to LAX because i had a flight from LAX to SFO on Virgin....well I was totally fine with the Virgin flight. That is not the one that I wanted changed. I wanted to get out of Tokyo because of the storm. After hours and hours and hours they told me that they could not change it again due the flight on Virgin. So finally just told them move the Tokyo flight and i will deal with the virgin flight.

Soo pissed off!!!! I eventually got the flight moved from Monday to Sunday which cost me $175 extra. But then at that point they said that they could not take my payment and that i would have to wait for ""some time"" for them to call me back. well i am on vacation in a different country so did not have the luxury of waiting for  ""some time"".
So at this point, i had to call my insurance company to get them to change my flight and take my payment. Uhhh just writting this makes me hate this experience.

So now i need to file a claim with my insurance because they could not do something so simple as change a damn flight. Its not that hard. And if you cannot change a flight because of a different company...then learn how to do it. Its so easy.

Oh they did send me  a letter later saying ""sorry"" but no type of compensation. Just oh yeah hey we messed up.

Such poor customer service. Dont think i ever want to give these guys my money again."|singapore-airlines
848|Worst customer service. Booked tickers 6 months in advance for my parents who are 70+ years. Looks like they cannot get Seats together. Only option is to buy seats in advance for $20 each to get seats together. They can pre assign Seats only for families with Kids. No respect for Elderly senior people. Hats off to Singapore airlines shows how low they can get to make money.|singapore-airlines
849|I remember taking this airline at least three times. I must say I really enjoyed the business class back in the day. Now it is 2015 and it has been almost a year since the last time I took it. They have made changes to Super economy class which includes champagne. I however like EVA air  for economy class, on Singapore air go for the business class. It is set at a very reasonable price no matter what time of the day you fly. Usually this depends on the type of aircraft that is assigned to you. I however am proud I am frequent flyer miles card holder. The have special benefits for people who have the same card as me. I really like the amenities they provide for me. The crew is nice and really outgoing. Who knew I would find some airline employees just like me. Tourist, resident or diplomat, you got to ride this or EVA air.|singapore-airlines
850|"My goodness the staff is so nice and the food ""oh so good"". but it would be great if going to Singapore can have a layover but we do know it may not happen. master of efficiency"|singapore-airlines
851|I love flying Singapore airlines. I was able to leave sooner for my vacation to Bali then originally planned and had a customer service rep graciously help me find another flight and for not a huge price difference. Once on board the stewards are all so kind and helpful and the seats are noticeably wider and more comfortable then most airlines. The food is good and they cater to vegetarians which some airlines don't do. The personal toothbrush and toothpaste plus stockings is a nice and simple touch to add to a long flight and the movie selection is always plentiful. It's airlines like these that make long trips much more manageable and even enjoyable.|singapore-airlines
852|"By the way...

If you are thinking of flying on Singapore because you are a United MileagePlus member and you want miles, you should either avoid them altogether because they don't give miles for most of the reasonably-priced fares (smartertravel.com/travel…) or at least read the fine print very carefully (united.com/CMS/en-US/mar…) to make sure that you are flying on a booking class that they usually award miles for and hope for the best, because sometimes they have been known not to award miles even for those booking classes they have agreed to credit.

Really, you should fly Asiana though which has better food and service. They have always credited me with miles. ANA appears more generous also, they also have better food, and the toilets on their Dreamliners have electronic bidets.

Singapore airlines also didn't give me lounge access in Hanoi even though I am a star alliance gold member."|singapore-airlines
853|"Do not bring two bags and expect to be able to check them both on economy from Paris to Singapore. I was told the second bag would cost 600 euros. I threw away clothes at the De Gaulle airport. They also said I couldn't bring my guitar on board, so I offered it to a janitor because I couldn't bear to throw it away. Then I walked back to the counter and got another attendant who was much more helpful, and she checked my guitar immediately without charging me. Maybe if I had gotten her in the first place, I wouldn't have had to throw away so much clothing.

When you pay 900 Euros for a one-way ticket, is it unreasonable to expect your second checked bag to cost less than half the price of the ticket itself?

I have trouble seeing what is so good about this airline, especially to the point that it would justify their prices, which are often 40% higher than many other airlines on the routes I check. In terms of in-cabin service, I think Korean Air, Asiana, Emirates, Qatar, Turkish, KLM, and maybe even Air France are at least as good or better."|singapore-airlines
854|"I recently took a 33 hour trip over to Vietnam, with layovers in both Seoul and Singapore. I was dreading the experience, but as soon as I stepped on board, I had a feeling I'd cope just fine.

The onboard entertainment was oustanding. Due to a snafu w/ my departure flight (I didn't have one!), I wasn't able to pick up any books or magazines prior to boarding. With only my IPOD to keep me sane, I was thrilled to find countless movies (both old and new), television shows, music, and books on tape. In addition to all that, I also found the magazine racks on the plane (near the flight attendant stations) and grabbed the latest Time, Business Week and Asian fashion mags. Seriously, my trip FLEW by with no problem.

The reason I am docking a star is because they are very strict with visas. I almost missed my flight because they held me at the counter for over an hour. They insisted I book a departure flight out of Vietnam and I was unsuccessful as their wifi kept going down. I was only able to board once I signed off on a waiver. It caused a lot of unnecessary stress (especially since the flight crew had to send two employees down to escort me to the plane.) And of course, once I arrived, I had no problem at all getting into Vietnam without a departure flight. So book at your own risk. Another bit of a downer was the lack of variety on their vegetarian meals. I had literally the same meal three times. I can't even think of eating tofu curry again without gagging. Other than that, the experience was about as comfortable as a 33 hour trip could be. I would definitely book with them again."|singapore-airlines
855|I give them five star if they have ten star I would give them ten. I always fly with Singapore to Hong Kong for five years. I just love there service.|singapore-airlines
856|"Called to change the date for my return flight to Japan. They initially quoted me $50.

Called back later after verifying my dates, and they quoted $85. I said ""You just quoted me $85."" Singapore airlines replied -""Let me verify and call you back""

This conversation repeated several times over the past week. Several days later, and lots of no returned calls.

I end up paying $440 to change my flight. 9x their initial quote. Simply because they were lazy. I will never use them again, and I will never again send a family member on one of their flights.

Not worth my money."|singapore-airlines
857|have flown Singapore multiple times to Bali. I have also not flown them to Bali and the difference was night and day. They go out of the way to make you comfortable. The surfboards are not an extra fee. I have missed a flight before and was rebooked without any additional fees. I know that business class is a whole other animal but for an Economy seat, any additional fee is worth it versus the other alternatives I have used for international flights.|singapore-airlines
858|"Definitely the BEST airline I've flown with. I really, really hate flying. Nothing's worse than being confined to a small space and more or less forced to sit for hours on end. But my latest experience with Singapore Airlines was so incredibly pleasant, I didn't mind the 25 hour trek each way. And I was flying economy. I can't imagine what it's like flying business or first class. I really can't think of anything negative to say about them. And I'd definitely be willing to pay a little extra to fly with Singapore over other airlines in the future.

THE PERKS:

    + YUMMY FOOD. I love food and eating, and airplane food pretty much always disappoints me, but theirs is actually good. Definitely opt for the Asian meals rather than the American ones. It's a little sad but some of the meals I had on these flights were better than food I've had in restaurants.. They even serve legit desserts like ice cream and It's It ice cream sandwiches.
    + Complimentary alcohol. Yes, even for economy class. Wine, beer, hard liquor.. just don't get wasted.
    + Basically an endless supply of food. Their in-flight menu has a page of light snacks for in between the scheduled meals, like sandwiches, fruit, cookies/biscuits and chocolate.
    + In flight entertainment. Individual TVs with SO MANY OPTIONS. Movies, TV shows, music.. Even recent releases. I was never bored.
    + Pouches with socks and toothbrush/paste for long flights. So simple and easy to provide yet I'll bet a ton of people don't remember or bother to pack a toothbrush for overseas flights. And socks are easily overlooked! You don't realize you need them until your feet are freezing on the plane.
    + Hot towels to freshen up before a flight. I especially appreciated these if I had traveled through intense Asian heat and humidity.
    + USB outlets. We're so dependent on technology nowadays that you'd think this should be as basic as water, but I'm not sure that all airlines have these on their planes. Either way, seeing these definitely made me happy. Not that I really needed my phone for entertainment with their endless movie offering.

But what makes Singapore Airlines really amazing is their OUTSTANDING SERVICE. Like not just friendly, attentive, helpful staff. But they REALLY go over the top.

    + Going off on the endless supply of food.. You can ask them for a snack any time during your flight, and if you're too embarrassed to ask for more food, don't worry, they're practically itching to give away food. I bumped into them in the steward(ess)/kitchen area on the way back from the bathroom, they'd just ask me if I wanted a snack. And when I simply asked them for a cup of water, they offered me food as well.
    + Toys for kids. Sorry to all the parents out there, but crying babies/children on planes are the worst. There's absolutely no way to escape so you're just trapped with the screeching and wailing. But thank goodness for Singapore Airline's foresight into this problem. I've seen the stewards and stewardesses bring kids toys and crayons and things to keep them entertained and to try them to stop crying for the sake of other passengers. Doesn't always work, but it's the thought and effort that counts.
    + The steward/stewardesses would actually turn on my reading light for me when the cabin was dimmed and I was reading/writing in dim light because I didn't want to disturb my neighbors.
    + Continuing on my idiocy, I left my glasses on the departure leg of a roundtrip flight. I emailed Singapore Airlines, feeling very frustrated with myself, and they replied promptly, telling me I could pick up my glasses at the check-in counter any time during working hours. I, unfortunately, was already leaving for a different city on my trip, but they were happy to hold my glasses until I was back for my returning flight. When I went in to check in for that flight, I didn't even have to mention or ask for my glasses. One of the staff came up to me as I was being checked in and brought me my glasses without any effort on my part!

Seriously, if you're flying to/from/within Asia and have the option of flying with Singapore Airlines, DO IT."|singapore-airlines
859|I had a much better experience as a passenger on Singapore Airlines than I did as a customer dealing with their website.  The customer service is excellent. They are polite and smiling and they go the extra mile. There's lots of free booze, which we really needed on a 14 hour flight to Hong Kong. I can see why they get all the good reviews.|singapore-airlines
860|"I am not happy and I have not even got on the plane yet. I paid $75 extra for a premium seat and when checking my ticket found that I had not been assigned a seat even though I had already been given a seat number. The seat I had been given was now up as ""available"" I called the airline and got the same seat that I had paid extra for back. Then I got an email from Expedia saying I had been bumped again. In addition their website is the worst I have encountered on any airline. It is so frustrating to use that that alone will stop me from ever flying with them again."|singapore-airlines
861|"I have loved Singapore Airlines in the past.  Our last trip to Southeast Asia was not so good.

All Singapore Air flight attendants used to be awesome.  They used to treat you so good.  Most of the flight attendants on this trip were nice.  I'd say only one flight attendant in each section was great.  At least one on each flight (out of six legs) was completely rude.  Unacceptable for such an expensive flight.  

The ""new clean"" blankets that were on our seat were stained with red wine and the pillows had dirt and hair all over them.  

The internet did not work for our entire trip (going over to Cambodia or coming back).  I understand this is a luxury to have in flight, but don't advertise it if it isn't going to work.

My husbands entertainment screen did not work on the flight back from Japan.  Talk about a miserable ten hour flight.  It was a full flight so the flight attendant could not move him.  They didn't even seem to really care that it wasn't working.  Just said sorry and offered to bring him some magazines.  

A gate agent in Singapore was less than helpful when we asked for assistance.  Our group of five wanted to sit near each other.  When we asked him to check and see if there was anything he could do, he said it was an oversold flight and there wasn't anything he could do.  He didn't even try!

I am so disappointed with Singapore Air."|singapore-airlines
862|I have spent two weeks trying to open a Krisflyer account.  I have applied twice as the first application's email (which I never received) had expired.  The second one didn't arrive either.    I have spent three hours on the phone with folk that promise to call me back or solve the problem to no avail.  And, if they do call back, they ask the same questions over and over and over again....but there is no solution.  I am flying with this airline tomorrow and hope that their flight crew is more competent than their land crew.  I  am going to open a Starlite  account with another partner airline and lforget Singapore.|singapore-airlines
863|My wife broke her knee while on overseas travel.  The doctor's had requested that she keep her leg straight and elevated. I tried to work with Singapore Airlines to get her into a seat that could accommodate her. After 15 e-mails and about 5 hours on the phone, they offered to charge the going rate for an upgrade from SIN to SFO for only $3,000.00! I had checked their website before I called, and they only want $3,300 for a new ticket.  I guess upper management at Singapore Airlines doesn't really care about the passengers, only about lining their pockets. Terrible customer service...|singapore-airlines
864|"I used Singapore Airlines to fly home from HKT. My luggage did not make it back on the same flight. I arrived at the airport a few hours early to avoid any problems. Our boarding time came, and we were still all waiting outside the gate. No communication. No one knew anything. When I asked about the flight, the people working the gate didn't know anything. I became worried I wouldn't make the next flight from Hong Kong to sfo. They assured me everything would be ok. We boarded late and left late. Boarding for the flight to Hong Kong was at 530 pm, we landed at 550pm. As we left the gate we were pretty much rushed by airport workers in Singapore  to make it to our next gate. Completely out of my hands why we were late. As my friend and I were getting Carted to our next gate, the gentleman on the cart very briefly said we needed to hurry, and that our baggage wasn't flying home with us. His words were ""maybe it will arrive tomorrow morning, maybe. I can't make any guarantees"" this made us both want to cry. Everything was in my luggage, I had my meds, clothing, important items I couldn't afford to lose. It made me so sick to my stomach not knowing where my baggage would be, and when I would see it again. The gentleman who told us about our baggage had no compassion, and rushed us off the cart to the gate. We couldn't really inquire about our stuff because the plane had boarded and they were waiting  to leave. Once we finally landed we were told to go to customer service. We filled out a claim and were told our baggage was going to be on a flight that arrived the next morning. And that we would get a call in the morning. This was very inconvenient! Not cool at all. I would have been a little more understanding had any of the staff been compassionate about the whole thing but the staff was very robotic, and dismissive. I didn't hear back from anyone the next morning, I waited till late morning around 11am, and called the number they gave me only to be forwarded to a voicemail. How frustrating! So I went to the website they gave me, SITE NOT FOUND... wtf? Seriously? At this point I'm beyond jet lagged tired, and annoyed cause I still didn't  have my stuff. Finally late afternoon after 4pm, my luggage got delivered. Big inconvenience. I will not be flying with Singapore air again. The worst part, no compensation for putting me or my friend out. Which is ridiculous with the amount of money we both spent to fly with this airline. NEVER AGAIN. I do have to say the flight attendants were very sweet. Other than that customer service is a shit show. No communication, and very robotic."|singapore-airlines
865|"Wow. My experience with Singapore was many times and many ways better than that other airline *ahem* United. My only complaint would be the dated interior of the plane and the uncontrollable variables of crying babies, cramps and aches.

Raves:
-great staff: friendly and accommodating
-warm cloths: for wiping hands and faces
-free headsets: not the crappy ones, although they do take them back
-individual kiosk system: control over what and when you want to do something (ie: no need to crank necks to watch some sucky movie with everyone else)
-awesome entertainment: whole library of movies, games, music and etc. entertained throughout the flight
-personal travel kits: socks, toothbrush and toothpaste for the flight
-food: depending on the destination and passengers, they provide a variety for different palates. and just know that they give you a lot, and feed you often
-drinks: complimentary alcohol (reds, whites, hards, beers) keep it flowing!!
-on time: if not earlier than scheduled. always a plus!

Highly recommended ! =D"|singapore-airlines
866|"I LOVE Singapore Airlines but I am VERY disappointed with this customer care services. They person on the other end could NOT hear anything what I say!! Unbelievable. My reception was great and I have a top edge android phone. The conversation was really really bad.

A customer Care representative of such a renowned airlines company does NOT have good telephone systems?? Such a pity."|singapore-airlines
867|"My first phone call to the customer service was really a nightmare. I had a challenging time to understand the customer service representative. For courtesy reason, I didn't tell her that I barely could understand her English but kindly asked her to slow down. She simply ignored me and rudely told me that all the customer service representatives from Singapore Airlines speak English only.

I didn't feel like correcting her attitude over the phone. So, I asked her about the round trip ticket price from Bangkok to Singapore in early November. She quoted $980 for the flight. I just purchase my tickets from San Jose to Singapore (November as well) with ANA and the round trip ticket is only $670. So, I asked the customer representative to check the price again. She was very impatience and raised her voice.

On the same day, I checked Singapore Airlines official web site and found the USD 233 ticket price. Where is the business ethic? Totally rip off from Singapore Airlines.

Two days later, I make the reservation on the official website for USD 233. The receipt and confirmation do not specify any cancellation policy or change of traveling dates.

Regardless my previous unfavorable experience with the customer service representative, I called the customer service hotline again. I was told there is no way I can change the date of my trip and I will never get a single dime back if I cancelled my trip. In other words, the customer service representative simply told me that Singapore Airlines will not give the customers any options. Again, what kind of customer service you have?

Excuse me. I am really disappointed with Singapore Airlines. Couldn't Singapore Airlines improve a bit and assist your customers?"|singapore-airlines
868|"I have nothing but high praises for Singapore Airlines. Singapore Airlines is the standard that many look up to when it comes to air travel. With their iconic ""Singapore Girl,"" and the high standards the cabin crew are held accountable for, you can expect friendly and down to earth service while cruising to your destination.

I have flown with Singapore Airlines on numerous occasions and have been pleased with the service on every single flight. The cabin crew really seem to enjoy what they do and you can see it as they are very customer service friendly. When is the last time you've flown and you've been greeted by name throughout the entire flight? If you fly predominantly in the US I'm sure your answer is probably not too often. Singapore Airlines does the little things right that other carriers fail to do.

The onboard services are wonderful too from the food/beverages, in-flight entertainment, and cleanliness of the aircraft. Yes the food is good :) In regards to entertainment none of that continuous looping. It's all on demand so you get to watch or listen when you want.

On this trip I flew from Singapore to Tokyo and then from Hong Kong back to Singapore. My flight from Singapore to Tokyo was on a Boeing 747-400 and fortunately I was flying in First. It was so nice to see the SkySuites again. For passengers flying in Business or First you have the option to Book the Cook (BTC). The BTC allows you to pre-order your meal from a list of other menu items. These items range from lobster thermidor to local specialties. For this sector I decided I would BTC the Kyo-Kaiseki, which is a Japanese selection featuring many small plates. No trip on Singapore Airlines in First would be complete without a glass of Dom Perignon. Yes they serve both Dom and Krug. The meal service on SQ is a perfect dining experience in the skies. Everything is done with precision whether it's the direction of your glass with the ""F"" logo lined up to the location of the utensils.

First Class passengers are also given amenity kits by Salvatore Ferragamo and sleeper suits by Givenchy. The men's amenity kit included an Incanto Pour Homme Assortment of Eau De Toilette Incanto Pour Homme, after shave emulsion incanto pour homme, lip balm tuscan soul, and hand cream moisturizer tuscan soul. All of the goodies in the amenity kit come in a nice travel bag. The sleeper suits are like sweat pants with a quarter zip matching top. I can't tell you how nice it is to arrive at your destination in with a fresh set of clothes since you can fly in the sleeper suits. In all instances a member of the cabin crew will hang your clothes in the closet for you so you don't need to find a place to store your clothes.

Once you're ready to get some rest the SkySuite is transformed into a lie flat bed by a member of the cabin crew. The sky suite is lined with an additional mattress pad for added comfort and topped off with a warm duvet. When you wake up rest assured you will be greeted with a warm towel and a beverage.

It's always quite depressing to leave the lovely confines of the SkySuite. Upon deplaning you are thanked by name by the cabin crew. I can't stress enough how nice it is to feel so welcomed when flying Singapore Airlines.

My Hong Kong - Singapore flight was on a Boeing 777 in First. While they used a regional aircraft for this route the services were equally superb. They don't have SkySuites on their regional aircraft, but this really isn't such a big deal for their short haul flights. I had initially BTC, the lobster thermidor, but went for the ""Shi Quan Shi Mei,"" otherwise known as ""a complete and perfect chinese culinary experience.""

I urge you all to splurge once in a lifetime and fly Singapore Airlines in one of their premium cabins. You won't be disappointed!

""Singapore Girl, you're a great way to fly."""|singapore-airlines
869|"I flew to Hong Kong on Singapore Airlines during my most recent HK visit in Summer 2011. Confession: the spacing of seats between front and back are a bit wider than Cathay Pacific. The staff speak English and Mandarin so of course this is always helpful. This is the same airline I flew on when I was coming back to San Francisco.

Overall, the service and provided on board airline meals are also very good. I find it very satisfying, I might just fly to Hong Kong via Singapore Airlines if the seats on Cathay Pacific are completely booked. My overall experience with Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific Airlines were very satisfying. I can't seem to find anything I disliked about their services.

On board entertainment is provided for long distance flights traveling halfway around the world. This is one of the amenities you'll see on board Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airline or any airlines that travel around the world. Flights to countries like Hong Kong, Vietnam, Japan, Taiwan, Korea and Philippines can last 14-16 hours or maybe longer depending if that particular flight makes any stops. 1 stop or 2 stops as in having to change planes at another airport!"|singapore-airlines
870|"- We requested Kosher meal through website and confirmed with ticketing and reservation over phone before flying, but when travelling no Kosher meal was provided. In fact, the flight attendant flatly denied that we requrested it. So, could not eat during the flights.

- BEfore flying, every time I called Singapore airlines in USA, I had to wait long. In worst case, it was 3 hours.

- Despite stating that you will be able to choose seats 48 hours before departure, they did not allow any seat preference.

- Looks like nobody in Singapore Airelines listens to their custmer service note/instructions (about meals and seat preferences in my case). So, don't waste your time calling them.

Why pay more to fly with Singapore Airlines while they can't accomodate basic needs on board !

I or my family will not fly with Singapore Airlines ever again!"|singapore-airlines
871|"Woohoo, I am in the club now!
I can now brag about flying on Singapore Airlines!

All I can say is WOW!
Fantastic service!
I flew them from Bangkok to Singapore.
The entire experience was pleasant. From purchasing the ticket, pre-boarding, inflight service and contacting them afterward to get my mileage points.
Extremely professional airline.

When boarding the flight, I could smell the food warming up and it made me very hungry. The food was amazing!
I think it was chicken curry along with some sides. The drinks came around often which was very nice as well.
I liked their interactive entertainment system.

The service was out of this world and all of the Singapore Girls were stunningly beautiful!

TO: SHIRLENE TEO, MANAGER LOYALTY MARKETING

I am writing to you, because I am very frustrated with Singapore Airlines and the way your company has been treating a loyal customer like me.  Below is the 3rd time I changed my flights, because every time I tried to redeem my points, there was always 1 leg of flight that I didn't get.  And, every time I called, the customer representatives are useless, even the supervisors are useless.  The people that answer my emails were even more useless!  

Look!  For this last booking I made, when I called, the rep told me all flights from Singapore to Jakarta are full!  THAT IS TOTAL BULLSHIT OK BULLSHIT!!!    I've flown SQ so many times, it started even when I was a baby.  I know for sure, when SQ says the flight is full, THERE ARE ALWAYS SEATS AVAILABLE!  So, do not give me some stupid reasons!

I think you guys are treating your loyal customers like a piece of shit!  Seriously!   I am very disappointed and angry with SQ now!  It really has messed up my plans, and it involves my wedding plans.  I am sorry I have recommended SQ to many people, but starting today I will not do so.

I WANT YOU TO TAKE CARE OF THIS ISSUE AND GET ME A SEAT ASAP!  And 1 thing for sure, I will make my complain visible to public.  Letting everyone know this is the way you treat your loyal customer.

My most memorable flight on this Jumbo Airlines was from SFO to Hong Kong... I really like Singapore Airlines alot what, I remember being on this plane was having fun watching a movie like the very first Lord Of The Rings movie and a comedy tv show like Mr Bean!!!

After several frustrating phone calls where PetMovers didn't answer their phones, I emailed them. They told me that they had no affiliation with Singapore Airlines, and that my cats would be put on a flight from Lufthansa. They also charge hundreds to thousands of dollars to move a pet - NOT what my original impression was. Nobody at Singapore Airlines was able to help me with pet information.

877|"There are really no appropriate words I can find for Singapore Airlines, other than FLAW-FREE.

Their prices are competitive, and their standards for comfort and service greatly exceed that of any other airline I've flown with - and for those interested, I make my comparison against Lufthansa, Air France, United, JAL, Aeroflot, Jeju Air, and LOT.

My flights with them are 10-12 hours in duration. I generally don't like flying (not to mention fear of heights!) but they make it bearable. Each time, I boarded one of their Boeing 777-300ER's. On the plane, each seat had its own screen with a remote, which operates a comprehensive entertainment system. I was thoroughly impressed, browsing through all the choices of movies, dramas, and music that they had to offer. They have virtually any genre of music or motion picture that you can think of. Throughout the entire plane ride, I didn't even find the need to take out my iTouch or DS!

The in-flight service was equally wonderful, as the famous Singapore Girls did not disappoint.The attendants were all very hospitable and friendly - not to mention attentive! Drinks and snacks were being brought by around the clock, they even offered some wine and cocktails (an offer I took advantage of!) Passengers were fed an entire three meals within each flight, with the meals being so sumptuous that, by the 2nd mealtime, I was unable to finish all of my food.

I'm going to be flying with them again in the coming spring, and I rather look forward to it!"|singapore-airlines
878|"Singapore Airlines is probably the best experience i've had in economy class.
They offer you a hot towel before takeoff and before landing which is extremely helpful and refreshing.
The entertainment system provides countless movies and TV shows.
The staff are very friendly and are always trying to help you
Im usually unable to sleep on flights but i slept for a good 5 hours since the seats are pretty comfortable.
The 10 hours flew by really fast while flying Singapore Airlines"|singapore-airlines
879|I don't fly long haul flight for more than 10 years and decided to visit Singapore for week. I choose Singapore Airlines on Expedia, very good price for long round trip, foods were great, not bad seating for big guy likes me, both pilots and flight attendants are very professional and overall experience is excellent. Seat selection, online checkin on app was very convenient, ground staffs are very helpful and nice. I don't mind to fly again with SIA in near future to other destinations. Also recommended to choose this airline.|singapore-airlines
880|I flew them international from Singapore to Beijing in July '13. The flight service was good, but the only reason I flew them was that they are Star Alliance and I wanted the miles. Come to find out they have fare class restrictions. V, Q, G, N or T classes don't get miles on Star Alliance partners, and this wasn't obvious when I bought the ticket. Bottom line for Star flyers - fly some other airline that doesn't have this unfriendly policy.|singapore-airlines
881|"Having flown domestic airlines for a while, I had forgotten that flying could be fun... that is, until I flew Singapore Airlines recently.

Where to start? Helpful, charming and competent attendants. Meticulous attention to detail e.g. restrooms were clean, spacious (esp. the baby-changing one) and water drains in the sink automatically. Endless food anytime you want. Numerous high quality movies (watched ""The Social Network"" and ""Inception"").  

Even the long 16 hour flight didn't diminish the sense of fun. Especially as I landed in the beautiful Singapore airport with flowers and trees outside the windows, and a KOI POND and BUTTERFLY GARDEN inside the airport.

Wish I could fly Singapore Airlines everywhere."|singapore-airlines
882|"I freaking love this airline.

There's something about a plane, that as soon as I sit down..boom. I fall asleep. That's usually a good thing when everyone on the plane has to watch the same movie,  the seats are uncomfortable, there's crappy service and crappy snacks..

Even though I was able to sleep the majority of my flight..the time I was awake was very pleasant.

First, the ladies and gents workin the plane are smokin. Even the older men are silver foxes.

You get a hot towel as soon as you get on. Good to wipe your face. Especially when you were just hammered with India's heat and dust. Gross.

The snacks are first class. The drinks are plentiful. Don't forget the free alcohol. (One guy next to me loaded up on cognac like there was no tomorrow.)

The meals are quite nice. And you get TONS OF ICE CREAM!!

You get a nice amount of leg room, each chair has a tv..You can watch movies (new movies too, I watched a movie that was in theaters a couple months back only), tv shows, play video games, listen to music, etc. You name it. They got it.

And oh my god, Changi airport. The best damn airport EVER!

I would totally fly with them again next time I go out of the country. For this reason. After a 14+ hour flight I walked off the plane and I didn't even feel like murdering anybody."|singapore-airlines
883|"I've flown twice with them (round trips) from LAX to Japan (Narita Airport) and I really enjoyed my experience. Great movie selections and lots of free drinks to pass the 10-12 hour flights. There was one incident where the man sitting in front of me slammed into his seat knocking off everything on my tray onto me including the red wine I had been sipping (side note: when can we start yelping rude people?).  Thankfully the stewardess came to my aid to remove the stains covering the sleeve of my brand new white jacket.  She then proceeded to sit in the aisle while we worked on it getting the stains out with her magic (and saving my jacket)! So amazing - I couldn't thank her enough.  Only reason why I'm not giving 5 stars is because it is a bit slower service than I have experienced on other flights (air france and virgin) and 2 of the 4 flights they ran out of one choice of dish which was kind of a bummer so I strongly suggest bringing snacks or a meal from the airport if you're a picky eater like me 0:-)   But for the most part their food was really good.

Please note I have never had to call them or use any services with changing flight dates or contact information which I've read is awful through other yelp reviews.  I arrived 3 hours before my flights, checked in and hung out until boarding each time with no issues of lost luggage."|singapore-airlines
884|"Singapore Airlines still does not disappoint.   Their level of service is beyond Outstanding and far outweighs the level of service or comfort any American carrier.

Although their ticket prices are not always the most inexpensive, they are worth the few extra bucks because I know I will be treated well by an attentive crew and excellent food.  

Thank you SIA!!"|singapore-airlines
885|"Singapore Airlines to the best airline in the world!

Great customer service, attentive flight crew, great food, the list goes on and on.

Keep up the great work SIA!

Cheers!"|singapore-airlines
886|"If only I can give them 0 stars. I booked a ticket to south Korea(somewhere in may) before the whole MERS virus issued  happened, and my flight was on the 22 of July. After I found out about MERS I contacted them asking to cancel my flight but they said I wouldnt be able to get a refund and loose all the money so I told them what was happening in Korea. The lady I was talking to said only people in June was able to cancel and get the refund. I asked why, and she said because MERS might die down in july. I thought it was reasonable so she told me to give a call on the first week of july in case MERS doesn't die down  so we can talk about the refund. I called 3 times because the virus didn't die down and all 3 times they kept telling me my ticket was unrefundable because due to their policy. Just in case the virus might get better I waited another week and called them again. This time this Indian guy picked up and I was explaining everything, and the first thing he did was he gave me attitude. I told him about MERS, and from what I'm hearing on the Korean news the death toll due to MERS increased and it started spreading to the philipines. And he said they recieved no information about how MERS was getting worse. I asked him to reconsider my situatuion , because I am an US citizen, if I do get caught with MERS I can't go back and I would have to stay in Korea, I don't even live there. So in the end he kept giving me attitude and I asked to talk to one of the higher ups and he kept making excuses so I wouldn't be able to talk to the high ups. They said I couldn't get the refund, nor get credit. I don't understand.... Singapore airlines wants to risk people's health because they dont want to loose their profit..... I can assure them that I will never ever book any flights from them and tell everyone I know.
Thanks for being a pain in the ass Singapore airlines, I'm about to loose around $1k because of some virus that's happening in Korea because I don't want to risk my health. GREATLY APPRECIATED"|singapore-airlines
887|"Singapore Airlines exceeded my expectations.  Its the only way to fly to Asia.  

Leg room: Good enough for a 6'3"", 210 lbs guy like me (except when the guy in front of you lays in your lap).  So its best to sit in the emergency exit row if your large or like the leg room.

Food:  It was pretty good.  They give you food on a one hour ride between Singapore and Malaysia; and it was much more than peanuts.  The dinners were edible with beef in a red wine sauce, or chicken stuffed with chesse, and smoked salmon salad.  No charge for wine and beer.  

Entertainment: When 18 hours seems long....Singapore Airlines makes it seem short.  You will have your own 4"" monitor with movies not even on video yet.

Other Notables: No charge for more than 1 bag checked, they didnt even charge me for my bag being over 50 lbs. I love how they give you a hot towel before eating.  I just wish they can keep people from farting on the plane! (WTF, I mean really...WTF)"|singapore-airlines
888|"SW just pulled a heavy five stars for their performance on a flight over the Christmas holiday. The employees were a treat from check-in to stewarding. I'm here safe and sound, so the pilot gets his nod, too!

I was so exhausted on our trip to Chicago, I passed out, cold. I'm told snoring and everything. 20 minutes later I had a huge PTSD incident and awoke to two attendants looking to help me. Mrs. E. says they heard the noise and responded in seconds. Embarrassing on me; impressive on them!

My remaining time in the air I stayed awake and played sudoku. They repeatedly checked on me and asked if I needed anything. Thank you!

All the while, two asshats were complaining up a storm about having to wear a mask and acting as if they didn't understand the proper way to wear one. Finally, in the end, yelling at the attendants because of the rule. As if these two ladies invented the concept and procedure. They were both professional and courteous to these morons and should've been given medals.

On another note, I wish the airline stuck to it's no occupying the middle seat policy. I'm not naïve, I full well understand why that isn't practical. Being more or less pressed into this flight, I still have concerns about everyone's safety.

We fly home next week, I pray that one or both of these exemplary employees are on the flight. FYI, I've contacted the airline by phone, email and am writing a formal letter detailing the events of that flight. 12/20"|southwest
889|"Review #182 - 2020

We've flown Southwest for over a decade and I've lost count of how many flights I've been on, but flying in and out of Southwest-Midway was not as customer friendly as I've been used to all these years.

Flight attendants have a not so friendly attitude, which I honestly understand everyone's concern during this whole COVID era.  Honestly, I don't understand why forcing a 4-year old to keep her mask on for a 4.5-hour flight is such a big deal.  

Kids in general don't like having things covering their faces for an extended period of time; but having to breathe in the same air for hours on out is definitely no fun, even for me as an adult!

I know everyone's scared of getting sick; but I honestly don't understand the fear, yet you're still willing to fly for hours in an enclosed space breathing in recycled air with hundreds of people while crying about a child not wearing a mask.

If you're really that scared, then you should stay in a personal bubble so no one else can intrude in your personal space!

Plus, I noticed that one of the flight attendants used a coffee pot to pour hot water into the toilet to wash down whatever was left behind by the passengers.  You're worried about kids not wearing a mask?  That should be a bigger concern!!"|southwest
890|"Southwest Airlines is the easiest way to fly from Chicago to Houston. No change fees. Many nonstop flights. Inexpensive fares if booked ahead.

Recently flew on an unexpected and unplanned trip. Booked a couple of weeks ahead for $42 one way. Boarding is currently in groups of 10. Middle seats are open. Face masks are required. A glass of water and a snack are served midway through the flight. You can also bring up to 12 ounces of hand sanitizer in your carry-on.

Service with a smile, now covered by a face mask. Just Plane Smart."|southwest
891|"I am a far cry from reaching my goal of reviewing every Southwest Airlines in every city I fly. This is a goal for 2020 to complete because my experiences are positive and I want to share.

I choose Southwest pretty much exclusively if I can. The number one reason is they are most often on time. However a close second is that they are a company with a big heart. The staff from check in to flight crew are some of the best! Have I had mediocre experiences, well yes but it's uncommon. Also they often come in with excellent pricing. Finally the two bags fly free can't be beat.

My most recent flight was delayed due to snow. The grounds crew was efficient and cleared the runway with a 15 plow convoy. If you've never seen this it's pretty cool. Also the deicing machine had us taken care of in around 20 minutes. Time was made up in the air and the flight was only delayed 10 minutes into Atlanta.  

Southwest does things differently and they pride themselves on being a unique caring airline. I think the extra attention provided by the desk agent is indicative of the overall customer oriented culture."|southwest
892|"Five stars, all the way. I am that person that packs literally 10 minutes before we have to leave on a trip, every single time. Do I strive to be better at this? Yes. Has it been my New Years resolution multiple times? Yes. However, Southwest saves me every time because I get to bring two bags on for FREE so I'm always in luck. This is an incredible perk for flying this airline and I never knew how expensive bags were until flying on others.

I also think that their fares are generally lower than competition. We also have the luxury of being able to fly out of Ohare or Midway so we compare there also, but we find great deals all the time. The low fare calendar is like Christmas morning! I love traveling so finding random cheap flights for a quick getaway makes me so happy. They now also fly to some international places!!! We flew them to the Dominican Republic last year and the flight was great!

Their service is fantastic. All their flight attendants have smiles on their faces and I fly frequently. I'd say I use southwest at least 6-8 times a year. Their alcohol selection on flight impressed me so much! We went to Birmingham last weekend and started the trip off with some whiskey and ginger ales, because why not? They had Wild Turkey whiskey which is a great brand! We also somehow were on the same flight as my husband's aunt and uncle so our group may have got a little noisy in the back :D The attendants were supporting it because we were having the best time.

Last! If you're looking for a great credit card with perks, Southwest has a great card that credits you points per dollar spent. It is AMAZING if you travel a lot, rack up those points with this card, and I highly recommend this airline all around!!"|southwest
893|As a loyal customer I am very disappointed!  This past year I did everything in my power to achieve companion pass (as I have done for many years).  Southwest extended the companion pass for those who did not achieve this status but did nothing for those of us who worked hard to achieve it.  I would like my companion pass eligibility extended as long a those who did not achieve that status.|southwest
894|Southwest has lost my business for good.  they are  the worst company ever . Treating people like crap .my last flight was packed no empty seats and stewardesses were yelling at passengers for mask issues when the dumb bitch didn't even have hers on right. If your that dam worried about a fake pandemic why was every seat full? I had strangers sitting on both sides of me .where was the 6' separation? None side to side front to back none. This is a money game your playing. Hope you fail like all the small businesses .this was a las vagas to Sacramento flight.|southwest
895|Same old southwest BS customer service.   Avoid this airlines like the COVID   Racist rude and they shuffle you on and off like cattle in the most uncomfortable seats you ever sit in.  They bragged about additional seats and they did however they went with the cheapest seats available but it fit there cause more room for the cattle shuffling.|southwest
896|I am utterly disappointed in Southwest's control to maintain this virus. Sure, masks, air filters and incremental boarding slots help, but they only go so far. Why would this business make efforts to STOP providing services that prevent the virus (i.e. middle seats and promoting socially distancing)? Oh, just to make some extra money? How self-centered that is at a time like now. Unbelievable that professionals like Fauci have not spoken up about this horrible practice. There is a pandemic people; let's participate, fly and travel effectively and appropriately.|southwest
897|"Ended up here as a transfer flight headed to LAX and it was a full house! I'm glad there were multiple stewardesses to attend to us. They came by multiple times for drinks and once with snacks for our about 4 hour flight. Not the usual snacks either, they actually had Fritos, cookies, and pretzels. What a pleasant surprise!

Never realized their free WiFi only worked for their movies & also, the intercom for info from the pilot was very low but we could hear the stewardess fine."|southwest
898|"Their website says, ""We like to think of ourselves as a Customer Service company that happens to fly airplanes.""  I say, ""Yes, they have proven that they really do care about their customers.""  Here's my testimony:  Several months in advance of our travel date, I purchased ""Wanna Get Away"" tickets online.  But days before our trip, my Missus developed acute bronchitis and was in no shape to fly (much less infect a planeload of passengers).  So, we took advantage of Southwest's generous no-fee policy that grants passengers who book this type of fare the ability to make changes within one year of purchase date (if the new fare is higher, you pay only the difference).

Unfortunately, the unforeseen illness of another family member threw cold water all over our new travel plans.  When it became obvious that we would be unable to use our credit before it expired, I emailed Southwest Customer Service.  I soon received a semi-automated response that read merely, ""... We encourage you to use the funds before the expiration date.""

Dissatisfied, I went to an advocacy site - Elliott.org - to look up direct contact info for various Southwest executives.  My second email was answered promptly.  Even though I had purchased a non-refundable fare, the representative empathized with our predicament and made an exception for our case.  Southwest's corporate logo is a heart, and yes, these folks really do have a heart."|southwest
899|Southwest customer service is very disappointing. With COVID most airlines are refunding funds for flights that need to be cancelled BUT NOT Southwest. My got to get away flight they will not refund because COVID is not a valid reason they said!!|southwest
900|"Ok, ok. ..I take it back. Midway Airport aka Southwest Airlines  (Southwest accounts for 93% of their flights) isn't so bad now that they separate the TSA pre-check line. It literally went from a 40 min Monday morning wait to 5 mins.

The gates could still use more seats and charging stations, but overall a much better experience now that renovations are underway."|southwest
901|One security gate, one cainine. ..one f*** hot mess.  It is absolutely unacceptable the way Midway manages their checkpoint line. I fly out each Monday and the line is more and more ridiculous each week. There's a single line until the very end when they check for TSA pre-check. If you're familiar with Midway take a look at my picture. The line literally went all the way to the CTA Orange Line. Chicago is the third largest US city, but this airport is not equipped to handle the traffic. Even with Southwest being my preferred airline, I may switch to ORD if this continues.|southwest
902|Disappointing experience.  They placed my luggage on the wrong flight.  No sense of urgency in resolving the matter.  Poor customer service.|southwest
903|Southwest Airlines is a racist airline. They kicked off a black man for wearing a Trump hat and mask. I saw this. Disgusting.|southwest
904|"Um I just called southwest because I'm unable to check in due to day light savings time. This isn't anywhere on the site for mobile users and we have an early flight. They couldn't do anything for us but give us 2k points. Whose going to give us our time back.

Now we have to check back in an hour later taking more time away from our sleep.

The rep I just spoke with said. There's nothing I can do I get off in 8 minutes. He's name was Justin.

So I will be calling the Dallas office asking to speak to a manager Monday morning. They also confirmed that I was indeed correct about the information about day lite savings time was not listed on the via mobile app as of 6am est nov 2nd.

Lost time and sleep two things I can never get back"|southwest
905|"Wow... just accosted by an airline employee for what he said was my mask was not covering my nose . I have no doubt in my mind he picked me out because I was white- got in my face and asked @ if I was going to be a problem""  this is racism and is tolerated against white people as people are made to be afraid to stand up for themselves and their rights. I will pen a letter to Colleen Barrett when I arrive back and WILL NEVER GLY THIS RACIAT AIRLINE AGAIN. The jackass that accounted me was too afraid to give his name ... had disgusting dread locks - Christmas Morning MDW- Gate A11 ...."|southwest
906|"My family like many others have had to cancel upcoming trips. One would think SWA would be more accommodating than only issuing a flight credit.
Once things are back to normal, this multi-year A-List Preferred member is done with this airline. I'm sure United will be happy to receive a fifty trip a year customer."|southwest
907|"The most fair airline to the consumer. You can get a refund or change flights last minute without the penalty. What other airline does that?!
Morning flights are on time. The evening can be challenging but I'm used to it now. It's best if you have an A status, it's not hard to get if you sign with their credit card."|southwest
908|The airline will not refund or credit the EarlyBird Checkin enough with the Coronavirus going on.....Are they really serious???  It's there policy... can't believe it.  Yes, it's only $15 but at least credit it for a future flight.  Guess the airline really need the money|southwest
909|"I ride Southwest Airlines often, and I am still going to. I am writing this as a public service announcement in hopes that southwest will check the the reliability of their online check in system.

If you check in right at the check-in time (i.e. 24 hrs before your flight), the southwest website might glitch and not record your check inThe website checked me in at 7:30 or 7:31 (confirmed b7 slot). I did see a confirmation. When I arrived at the airport the next day, the system did not see my check in and I ended up at the c3 slot. Counter attendants said there might have been a computer glitch.

TLDR: Make sure to double check your online check in a few minutes afterwards. I had to learn this the hard way, from a b7 to a c3 slot. Southwest website may glitch."|southwest
910|"I love traveling with southwest
Is very budget friendly,  staff is always nice.  
If u get lucky may be evenone free booze.  
They also send u coupons for booze!  
I travel with them all the time.
Early bird option is also great."|southwest
911|Very fake-nice company desperate for money. Made the mistake of confirming a change to a flight that I was only trying to see how much it would cost. I IMMEDIATELY called to reverse it when I realized what happened, but even after spending lots of time on hold and talking to their very condescending customer support, they refused to issue a refund for the change I didn't want. I don't normally write bad Yelp reviews but they are bad enough to have brought out my inner Karen. Southwest stole my money because of a one-click mistake. I will be avoiding them from now on.|southwest
912|Staff is always very friendly, accommodating, and always puts customer service first. The prices have gone up, but when you fly with other airlines and they treat you like crap you really appreciate airlines like Southwest. Every state I've been in I've been treated exactly the same.|southwest
913|"Would give ZERO stars if I could!!!  Paid extra $50 to take a flight that was three hours earlier than I originally booked.  I had paid for early bird seating, which I lost ($40) AND got a deadly ""C"" seating.  Now they have delayed the earlier flight I paid for by 2 1/2 hrs; so I asked if I could at least get my early bird back - they said sure for another $40.  What a racket!!!  

When I asked at the gate they said ""no"" call client services.  When I called client services they said ""ask at the gate"" can't make this stuff up!!!

Customer service at its worst

JetBlue needs more flights so I can stay away from. Southwest for good.  I had forgotten why I stoped using them!!  Only take them out of desperation.

Ugh!!!"|southwest
914|"Stupid, Stupid Stupid!  Cancels all flights and won't give people their bags!

I hope you go out of business soon!  

Horrible company. Wish I could leave negative stars!"|southwest
915|"We fly Southwest regularly. On our last flight, the flight attendant
had her mask off almost the entire flight. She sat down and drank and ate almost the entire flight. There was only one pass through for trash early in the flight. This person who said she was ""Betty"" then demanded we clean up under our bulkhead seat and the aisle. She must have known that  Southwest wasn't going to follow up on our complaint. We called and emailed the airline but it never got back to us. Flight crew should be required to wear masks and not expose the customers. I will be complaining to the FAA."|southwest
916|Flight from Memphis to Midway was good. The flight was not packed so lots of room. The flight attendants were welcoming and the pilot was hilarious. A little sense of humor goes a long way.|southwest
917|"you guys fuckin suck ass! never flying with this airline again!

changed our flight twice on us. last minute changed our flight again while on the way to the airport and because of that we were 5 minutes late to check in. they did not let us board and instead of getting to our destination a 1pm as scheduled, we now have gotten reschedule to leave 3 hours later, and connect in houston for a 3 hour layover causing us to arrive at our final destination at 9pm where we missed our entire day!!! this is fuckin ridiculous and i will never fly southwest again. go fuck yourselves, we just missed our best friends wedding because of you fucks!"|southwest
918|"If I could give this review zero stars I would. I came through Midway Airport from Vegas on Southwest Airlines which I almost never do, the flights back and forth from Chicago to Las Vegas and vice versa were bumpy and downright uncomfortable.
Plus when I came back to Chicago my large luggage bag was severely damaged and is totally unusable, I took this bag with me from Chicago to Boston (x2) , To Kansas City and to Los Angeles on American Airlines without any problems or damage whatsoever. The first time I flew round trip on Southwest and now I have to go out and buy another bag, I recommend another airline altogether."|southwest
919|"This review is in regards to SW Airline Corporation Rapid Rewards.  They do not have direct control over the points.  They handed it over to Points.com who has put stringent and unfair business practices in place.  If you transfer 10,500 points to a friend or family member they charge you $105 which means not only did you lose the ""free"" points from you existing points but also that you just ""paid"" for your free points.  You lose your points and your money.  I could understand a small fee of like $2.99 but to make you pay for your free points is not only illogical but it is unethical.  Read the small print folks!  After finding this out I cancelled not only my transfer."|southwest
920|"OK First off I am a LOYAL Southwest Customer!!!! it is unless unavailable the only airline I fly now having said that. Back in January 2020 I booked a flight there was a tragedy that prevented me from taking that trip. And Southwest being so easy to cancel your flight and save your money for a future flight did just that. WELL then COVID-19 hit and Living in Michigan we had Strict travel restrictions more then a lot of other places. SO I have not been able to use my travel funds. I looked at my account and it said that the Travel funds were set to expire on December 31,2020 so I called to see if due to COVID I could get those funds extended.  this is what I was told now my Travel Funds are for $200.00 I was told after they expire I have up to six months to call Southwest and get them extended ""AS A ONE TIME COURTESY"" but when they extend them they will take $100.00 off the fund balance as a fee. So basically if I can't use the by Dec 31st 2020 I will have to forfeit 50% of my travel funds to get that extension. I expressed my thoughts on this POLICY during this time and was told those funds didn't fall in the covid extension dates. SO NEEDLESS TO SAY THE POLICY IS BS AND I AM SO VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH SOUTHWEST and as soon as I use my Travel Funds I am going to start looking at other Customer Friendly Airlines. Which actually makes me sad I up until now have ALWAYS HAD GREAT EXPERIENCES WITH SOUTHWEST. But a policy like this during these strange time and wanting to keep $100.00 of my HARD EARNED MONEY DURING THESE TOUGH TIMES IS NOT ONLY TO ME THEFT BUT DISRESPECTFUL TO CUSTOMERS.  They already have my money so that aren't out anything it is JUST CORPORATE GREED AT IT FINEST.  SHAME ON YOU SOUTHWEST for TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YOUR LOYAL CUSTOMERS!!!!!!"|southwest
921|"MDW is a major base for WN, and I'll focus my review on the experience at this airport, as the in-flight experience is generally not related to any one particular location.

Things are a tad busy and hectic here at MDW, but the WN staff are generally able to maintain a professional game face and get the traveling masses in and out efficiently, whether at baggage claim, check-in, or onboarding. For example, I had a recent layover here and while my gate area was quite crowded thanks to a delay in our flight, the gate agent gave frequent updates on our arriving flight's status and managed to keep most folks at ease.

It was all an inoffensive experience - which is the most I can ask for when flying domestically these days."|southwest
922|I have flown Southwest often, but can no longer support them after seeing the way they treated a polite and compliant black man on their flight.  The proof of them targeting him has been out there on video for a while and they have done nothing but make excuses for it.  Absolutely disgusting.|southwest
923|Do not bother to accept a voucher from them! They are useless. Anyone can steal your number, use your voucher and not only will they not tell you who used it, but they won't replace them. Has to be an employee, as no one else would have access to your number! So use it immediately or lose it to an employee! I've been flying SW for many, many years because I had the credit card. Time for a new credit card and a new Airline!!!|southwest
924|This terminal is easy to find with helpful staff.  Smallerand similiar to others, I felt comfortable getting around thus Chicago terminal.  Clean, well organized|southwest
925|I always have a great flight on southwest. However, there are no barf bags in the seat pockets anymore. Why? Flying into Chicago in the wind can cause a lot of panicky air sickness feelings. I want a bard bag just in case. Years ago they were everywhere. Do people not throw up anymore?|southwest
926|"First time I flew SWA was on Halloween! Long enough ago that it was when they still had those aircraft with seats facing each other (as if in a train car!)

The whole cabin was TOTALLY decked out in black and orange and cobwebs and spiders. I was thinking, ""what the heck?"" having been raised on United, Delta, TWA and having to get dressed up to fly etc. ""Is this safe?!"" I thought. Lol.

It got crazier....Mid-flight, there were party games.

Left v right side of the plane!!!. ""Here's a roll of toilet paper.... let's see which side can roll it over head to the row behind and so on. Whichever makes it to the back without tearing....wins!!""  

It was awesome!! I miss those days now honestly. I give a five star overall but some workers could sure use a shot of that original SWA spirit. (Like the non-smiling ladies who checked me in today. They didn't bring me down though. I hope they can figure it out.)"|southwest
927|I always find Southwest to be dependable which is why I choose to fly with them.  On my recent trip to New Hampshire I slipped on some ice, and was therefore trying to fly back to Houston hampered by crutches.  Southwest employees helped me from start to finish - Boston to a plane change in Chicago, to Houston and the baggage claim all the way to helping me to the parking shuttle.  Thanks to Southwest and it's employees for the kind help!|southwest

929|Southwest used to be a lot cheaper to fly but the last few years the prices have gone up and the quality has gone down. They keep canceling my trips  and I have to keep calling since I booked the round trip it cant be changed online. The call takes over an hours for the operator ti answer and I finally get my flight changed. Now instead of a non stop I have to waist my whole day traveling. If I would have known this wasnt going to be nonstop I would have traveled another airline and I will next time.|southwest
930|Horrible to small children not required legally to wear masks|southwest
931|I haven't been on a plane in about 10 years. Nothing really changed from the whole flying experience. On our plane trip, alot of the material from the overheads were falling apart. Alot of the plane felt like it was made out of cheap plastic just by feeling the walls by the window and the overhead above us. The captains chair was having a bunch of mechanical issues that through our projected flight ETA way off. The part that irritated me the most was that they expected me to pay for wifi on the plane for $8, screw that.  Then again we live in a world where net neutrality doesn't exist anymore.Their slogan was a complete contradiction of their services and to think of the customers first. Staff was friendly for the most part but I don't think I would fly Southwest.|southwest
932|I LOVE THIS AIRLINE!!! They are my #1 choice. I recently took a trip to Ft. Lauderdale. You get to have two free bags, the staff are always professional, and the flights are affordable. I have never expressed experienced any hidden fees with southwest. I just booked another flight to New Orleans in February to attend Mardi Gras. I cannot wait.|southwest
933|The best airline for the money you spend. Always great experience flying Southwest and always excellent customer service.|southwest
934|"Pathetic. Lied to constantly on our flight from Midway (Chicago) to Newark, New Jersey. Absolutely the worst Airline ever.
Tried to placate the upset people with water and two bit snacks. A total disgrace.
Don't ever fly this Airlines. A truly piss poor experience. Nothing but a bunch of lying and untrustworthy individuals.
Never fly with these people."|southwest
935|Received email from Southwest related to coronavirus . The email  stated that they spend  6 to 8 hours nightly cleaning the planes.  It would help if Southwest provided wipes in the jet bridge so passengers could clean planes after every flight.|southwest
936|Still waiting for my text or email mentioning the gate change for 1615 from B19 to A19. Not happy especially since I've been at the former since 0945. Thanks a lot.|southwest
937|Wish I could give 0 stars. waited on hold for 4.5 hours then got disconnected. Called back several times spoke to several reps. Their policy for group bookings is use your flight as booked or lose your money. They want me to fly amidst a national crisis and pandemic to a location chosen for my cancelled cruise with my husband who has chronic respiratory issues and a child that has been feverish for 5 days. This of course would spread whatever illness she is carrying to others however the health of their customers seems to not be a concern of theirs. They should do the right thing during this pandemic. Refund our $2610 fare. This was our first booking ever with SWA what a poor experience with sub par customer service.|southwest
938|I always love flying southwest. Friendly staff and choose your own seats. Plus the 2 bags free! I've flown over 50 flights w/southwest and I've never had a bad experience. Delays are not something that can be controlled, so those don't count.|southwest
939|"The unfortunate thing about reviews, are that in high-pressure situations with tension and opportunity for things to go awry, negative reviews are heavily inspired. Reviews are not as frequently inspired, in my experience, when either an exceptional job is done or even a ""good"" job is done.

Well, Southwest blows my socks off every fricken time and I will sing their praises probably for the rest of my life. I have flown with a handful of airlines in my time since living in Chicago, being in a long-distance relationship, going on vacations here, and also going on some business trips, and time and again, Southwest is my guy.

Let me tell you why-

PRICES- If you book a few weeks in advance, tickets are usually very affordable on Southwest. I fly back and forth to Cleveland a lot because that's where my boyfriend lives and an average ticket is $109 one-way if I snag them a few weeks in advance, making it only a $110 cost for us to see each other each month (as we usually split round trip fares down the middle). WITH THAT...

CHECKED BAGS- One of the few airlines that (rightfully so) DOES NOT CHARGE EXTRA for checked bags. You get up to TWO checked bags complimentary. This means that on any given flight that I've taken, I am eligible to take a carry-on, a backpack or personal item, and two full-sized check bags. That alone saves me between $60 and $100 depending on the airlines if you factor in the ridiculous bag checking fees that many airlines get away with. My bags have also always been handled with the utmost care and respect, always getting them back in great condition.

TIMELINESS- I have probably been on 30+ flights this past year and of all the airlines I have flown, Southwest is the only one I have NEVER ONCE experienced a significant flight delay or airplane issue with. They always board when they say they will, depart when they say they will, and land on-time or early. If there is a small delay, you are always accurately and promptly updated. There was one delay one time (not of major significance) but I was told hours in advance so I knew I had more time to get to the airport rather than rushing there just to wait. Now, after boarding..

STAFF IN AIRPORT- When checking bags, I feel like I always dread talking to the people you check bags with at the counter because I have had such RUDE experiences. Not Southwest- always friendly, smiling, and happy to help.

STAFF ON BOARD- AMAZING PEOPLE. Literally, like the Chic Fil A employees of the sky. I don't know what they require for their hiring process, but let me tell you what, they're finding good people. Air travel can often be stressful, chaotic, and exhausting. It doesn't help when you board only to be met with equally stressful and exhausting members of the crew who irritate you. It especially doesn't help when you're hyper-cognizant of how expensive this last-minute flight was and then your attendant is extremely rude to you. Southwest attendants and staff and even the pilot (who will often say hi on the way in or out!) are not only kind and helpful, but FUNNY! I feel like on every single flight I've ever been on through Southwest, the person on the speaker was making jokes that were actually sarcastic and funny, not just dumb. Usually the whole plane has a few chuckles before it has landed again.

FLIGHT- Always incredible. Of all the airlines I fly, this one always makes me feel safest and most comfortable. Smooth landings, comfortable transitions. Even the night after the great Chicago ""polar vortex"" where there were only 15 of us on the plane, they got us there safely and comfortably.

FOOD ON BOARD- YES, FOR ALL. Some airlines are so cheap in that they will charge you $200+ for a ticket and then not even give you a 50 cent bag of pretzels or a complimentary drink unless you are in first class. Southwest? Nope. You get pretzels and drinks. Even two drinks if you want them. I have not yet ordered a paid-for meal on-board but a king lady I sat next to on one flight did and seemed to really enjoy the falafel and Greek salad.

CHANGE IN PLANS?- Again, pretty much the only airline I know of that allows you to make changes in your flight plans without the exorbitant fees, and one of the only airlines I know of that will negotiate a refund with you without all the bull and the fuss! Have done this a couple times with no issues whatsoever. That's transfarency ;)

POINTS- STACK THEM UP. I am probably going to get a Southwest card soon here just due to how often I use their airline.. If you spend $1000 in the first month I believe it is, you get 50,000 points which can pay for a few round-trip flights right there.

Overall, just a freaking fantastic airline. There's probably even more I missed but you get the gist. Great prices, amazing customer service, no hidden fees.. Just an amazing company and I love dealing with them."|southwest
940|"Flying SW into Midway is so easy.  Nonstop from PVD, easy terminal, manageable, easy access to the Orange line to get into the city.

The staff on board and on the ground are always so nice and so pleasant.  The great thing about picking your own seat is such a great perk.   Sad that no more peanuts on board, but I do understand, some people do have really bad peanut allergies."|southwest
941|"Nothing but great things to say about Southwest.  We only fly Southwest, and use their credit card.  Purchases equals flight points!  Southwest sends drink coupons occasionally for our birthdays or other occasions.  Trust Uncle Tim here, this is a bonus.  You won't suffer from the dreaded ""Short Shot Syndrome"" with them.  If you do not have drink coupons, drinks cost $5-no cash-credit cards or drink coupons only.    

The check in staff is always nice and friendly.  The flight crews are funny, attentive and top notch.  Lately, I have noticed the Captain and First Officer greeting and talking to passengers as they board the plane.  Southwest is the only way to travel for me."|southwest
942|"Southwest, curse you for not flying into O'Hare. I love their staff,  flights and prices but it's more difficult for me to fly them on a regular basis because they only go to Chicago's airport in the south, Midway.  

Really the staff on Southwest flights is so far beyond any other airline. They are always so friendly and often times really funny. Have you seen the rapping flight attendant? youtu.be/G9lZV_828OA
Yep. That's Southwest.

I find the pilots sometimes have the same sense of humor which can be really calming knowing their confidence. I dislike flying and they always put me at ease.

Free non- alcoholic drinks and peanuts! That's right folks, they still serve Honey Roasted Peanuts. Nomz!

No unexpected bag fees, no change fees, no hidden fees. And be sure to join their rapid rewards program!

You're great, Southwest!"|southwest
943|"I fly weekly, many weeks multiple times.
Flying a lot more out of O'Hare this year because of the increased number of options and, generally, more convenient times. Booked a SW flight on short notice this week, quick day trip to Baltimore. $800 for a flight I could get for less than $100 each way if I had some notice, but I didn't. Informed at 4:30am that my 5:30am flight was cancelled and I was now on a 7:50. Also got a way worse boarding pass. I know these things happen, but this apparently wasn't weather or equipment related. I booked that 5:30 with purpose. Southwest made a commitment and it wasn't honored. Inconvenient and frustrating. Just leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I'll keep flying SW because I have to."|southwest
944|I am posting this, not that I think Southwest Airlines will ever see it. I had to cancel a flight in September 2019. I have flow them many times and have always been happy. I had to cancel flights or reschedule flights... no problem. When I canceled this flight, there was a confirmation number given to me. I emailed a few months ago and was told flights were being extended another year because of COVID-19. I called last night and was told I had no credit, I was a no show. I told the representative that I had a confirmation number. I was told to call customer care. I did. The same thing. They said there was a two step process to cancel and I did not do step two. I have never heard of this. She would do nothing, would not let me speak to her boss. She said I just lost my 500.00. She sounded like she was reading a script. They will do nothing. I will NEVER fly Southwest again. There is always something you can do . I guess they have lost so much money with the virus, that any way they can screw you out of money, they will. This is the WORST customer service I have ever seen.|southwest
945|Southwest is the 2nd best airline Ive flown on...nothing to complain about really...wish they'd add more flights...especially out of ATL...but overall Ive had awesome service from their entire crew!|southwest
946|"Well not sure where to start. Booked are whole trip thru southwest
Flights hotel room and car rental. Get to the airport to check in to find out are return flights are changed to a day earlier. Now I have to get them to find us flights home on the day that it was suppose to be as to not lose money on are vacation that was planned months before. After a long time they were able to put us on a flight but was 6 AM screwing up the morning for us getting up at 2 a.m. to make flights. Don't think I'll fly southwest again. Bill sahagian"|southwest
947|"After taking Southwest many times, I understand that they have lower fares for a reason. However, when I get off a flight and have gum stuck to my shorts, on my shoes, and on my sweatshirt, it tends to irritate me. This is on top of knowing gum was on the bottom of the armrest, being that I put my hand in it.

Regular cleaning of the aircrafts is expected, no matter how cheap the fares are. This was a horrible flight from Chicago and I am still trying to get the gum out of my clothes. Southwest owes their customers better than this."|southwest
948|Great flight from Chicago to Vegas. Good deals. Easy access on and off the plane. Flight attendants were great with positive attitudes. Flight from Vegas to Chicago was a bit less desirable as WiFi was out and no one had access to the flight route. It would have been nice if the pilot would occasionally state where we were. It was dark and we never knew how close we were to our destination. Coming into Chicago was horribly foggy that night. The pilot went in a little hard, but landed us perfectly in through the dense sky.|southwest
949|I love flying southwest.  Everytime I fly another airline I get grumpy about the delays, the wait, the hassle.  Southwest makes it so easy for luggage, so easy to change flights, so easy to jump on earlier flights of they are available.|southwest
950|My layover inChicago (MDW) to DC (DCA) was one of the worst customer service I have ever experienced. The guy scanning tickets at gate B24 for the 9pm flight was extremely rude. I was misdirected and confused when my group was boarding. Upon entering the gate he saw I was boarding (when I was unaware I wasn't supposed to be without assistance because I was told by others to just scan the ticket and walk into the gate and notify him of the issue), instead of simply correcting a mistake I had made he started yelling at me. I understand I was in the wrong and was clearly confused as to where to go, but if you're a grown man why are you yelling at me in front of multiple customers.|southwest
951|"*****YOU ARE GONNA WANT TO READ THIIS*****
(1 star because 0 was t an option)

As a loyal customer is saddens me to write this review and now I put #SPIRITAIRLINES &  #FRONTIERAIRLINES ahead of #SOUTHWESTAIRLINES who completely dropped the ball-

- CXLD Flight Saturday morning 2hrs prior to take off (6am flight)
- COULDN't  get on another flight until 9pm the next day
(We were the 1st flight of the day for a 4 day trip)
- Reservations showed NO empathy and even had the audacity to tell us to drive to another city the next NIGHT
- Customer service wasn't available til Monday morning 48hrs later (that's crazy)
- We had  a non-refundable Hotel ($1800.00)
- We booked 2  one-way American for $1285.00 (to keep the trip and not lose out on hotel - transfers and event tickets) WE WERE POT COMMITTED AND WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT SW WOULD COMPENSATE BECAUSE THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS CLOSED)
- They do not even have a strategic partnership with other airlines
****TODAY customer service apologized and offered us (2) $100 vouchers**** WOULD YOU BE HAPPY WITH THAT???

It's not just the tough luck and inconvenience but the inability to mitigate the problem- I am reasonable enough to understand that full compensation is probably not possible but  ***I have seen people give up their seats in a plane for round trip tickets and up to $1000.00 vouchers *** and that's all you can do??? INSULTING

In total we stood to lose approx $1500.00  because there wasn't an option to travel- by creating our ONLY option it cost us $1285.59 (the fact that such a large company doesn't have a customer service rep available on the weekend it was impossible to weigh our options for out of pocket vs compensation

As a former loyal customer and former A-Lister if this conduct continues PLEASE SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE"|southwest
952|The ticket counter lady wanted the separate my 13 year old daughter from the rest of the family b/c we were A58-A60, and she was B1 Chicago to Orlando. I stood there while she called out three times for more A's before allowing the rest of my family to join us. If this person was one of my employees, she'd be having a long conversation with me about customer service. We usually have a decent experience with Southwest, but this made my blood boil.|southwest
953|Had my flight cancelled and my baggage was opened by TSA when I arrived at Albany New York my monitor and computer stuff was smashed to smithereens did not notice until next day when I opened bag their policy is for hours only after you arrive to make claims wasn't bad enough to cancel my flight and cost me $1,000 extra they didn't bother to find me a decent compatible flight or anything it was just tough luck buddy. Lady at the counter just would not find a decent flight for me it was mechanical did not offer anything did not give me cash did not try to find me another flight who's all on my own|southwest
954|Southwest staff I came across at Midway wasn't the usual for me. Most didn't look happy and didn't use pleasantries except one flight attendant. Seats are comfy and prices are affordable are benefits.|southwest
955|"I'm so very disappointed in Southwest after using them for my last trip to San Diego.  Boarded the plane on time and then took off over 30  minutes late, a family member's bag ended up in Austin, TX and the icing on the cake was the cockroach that crawled across my laptop screen.

Southwest, I have always been a fan.  Please get your act together."|southwest
956|"My wife and I were removed from a sw airlines flight to Phoenix,AZ. A flight attendant asked my wife to put her face covering from the tip of her nose to over the nose. She responded but said, ""if I pass out or start coughing will you help me?"" The flight attendant said he will have to get a supervisor, and my wife said I'll be okay. A few n minutes passed and another person came to us and said you disclosed that you have a problem with face covering and the captain does not want you on this flight. He removed both of us off the flight. This type of treatment to totally disrupt our travel is unwarranted and unacceptable. I asked for a manager but they couldn't get us on the same flight. Instead delayed us 4-5 hours. This has caused severe hardship trying to coordinate our shuttle pickup not to mention a huge amount of stress placed on us. The flight attendant apparently was trying to make himself look good by exercising ""over the top"" authoritive behavior and making a big deal out of nothing. SWAirlines you need to help yourself and be more tolerant of passengers."|southwest
957|"As a frequent traveler, I spend half my time on Southwest and the other half on a competitor. I don't understand why most people have such nightmares while traveling, perhaps it's just lack of knowledge or experience.

Logistics is a major factor in travels and let's face it, sometimes things don't always go as planned. Southwest has been consistent for on time deliveries but in the off chance things go astray, their customer service group is always there to rectify the situation.

In flight staff is always happy, friendly, and willing to help. As long as southwest holds true to their standards, I will continue my business!"|southwest
958|Bags fly free and $5 cocktails.  Not too shabby. Just bring your own device to watch a movie on.|southwest
959|"With all the normal hub bub of no selecting seats, $15 early check in and $40 at the gate upgrade to get on the plane early, irate passengers, interested employees...the plane was over 30 minutes late in taking off while waiting for their mechanics to arrive to ride with us to get on another plane.

It was already a late flight, I spoke with someone at Southwest and they said that this happens from time to time and we appreciate your patience. No real understanding or consideration for a Plane full of passengers who paid for that flight to leave at a certain time. Even though weather and mechanical issues get in the way and so it's understandable that a plane will be delayed, but it's not understandable for a plane to be delayed because of your employees that need to get a ride to another plane will be taking their time to get to the plane.

It's negligent and unappreciative for the service of their customers. I'm never surprised by Southwest."|southwest
960|"I usually LOVE Southwest. I recently got the Southwest credit card, I book a flight with them ATLEAST once per month, usually 2-3 times per month.

Today I have a flight to Newark scheduled for 6:15PM. It was delayed (no problem, I understand this happens), now the delayed time has changed 5-7 times. It's 11, it's 10, it's 9, it's 10, at 8:03 it's back to 9pm with boarding at 8:30.

Then we switch gates, no one knows. We were all in the wrong place. Now there are a ton of people standing in a crowded, hot hallway for 50 minutes and not a single person has boarded. Then you announce that the pilot isn't here. 9:08pm still all standing here.

I booked this earlier flight at a higher cost to be in New Jersey earlier and now I'm leaving later than the later (cheaper) flight.

People are very angry. I am truly disappointed. I understand conflicts, weather delays, etc. happen but the communication is horrible.

Southwest is also no longer flying to Newark airport starting in November. I have never been so disappointed in an airline. I talk about Southwest all the time. My sister and my mom recently signed up for credit cards and have made Southwest number one for booking flights.

Get it together Southwest. What is the problem?"|southwest
961|My choice to fly from Minneapolis St.Paul to Austin TX. I like the prices but you gotta purchase and check in quick to get a better crack at seating. They board by Letters A through C and if your a C your in the middle of a baby and a non bather....Internet is not free unless your a member of the club....No movies and No electric outlets....|southwest
962|"I have been repeatedly frustrated by the ""open seating"" on Southwest. It leaves customers either fighting for seats, or paying extra fees to board early when adjoining seats are actually available.
1-If you want to sit with family members, it is most effective to pay upgrade fees on EACH ticket to ensure being in ""A"" group.
2-Or you can take your chances sitting on your phone or computer at exactly 23 hours and 59 minutes from your flight time....and repeatedly click click click click to try to get  into an earlier boarding group. Sometimes this works....sometimes it does not.
3-Of course, the later you board, the only seats available are middle seats.....rows upon rows of only middle seats available.
4-Because of the ""open seating"" nonsense, earlier-boarding passengers ""save"" seats for others.
I asked a Southwest attendant at the desk about this and he said it is NOT permitted to ""save"" seats for others.
The entire ""repeatedly click to check in asap 24 hours in advance"" trying to click faster than anyone else and the seat-saving situation feels like we are immature children on a school bus. It is extremely frustrating and add extra complications to flying."|southwest
963|"This is the last time: I am clipping my Southwest card & never choosing southwest again: Between breaking my luggage, delayed flights (that resulted in) missing connections (that resulted in) missing big life events.

The issues that this airline has caused me MANY unforgivable problems.
I'm on a flight that was delayed an hour and a half  as a write: I just received an email telling me my flight is boarding.
Hence, this flight will be missed.
I have to work in the morning and I will miss dinner with my boss tonight.

964|"Southwest Airlines - 4 stars: This airline knows how to run an airline. If you are a planner and can figure out ahead where and when you want to fly, you'll get unbeatable prices. If you are a last-minute decider, you'll get normal high rates just like the other airlines. SWA rewards those that reserve early, and punishes those that don't. I suspect SWA is still the only airline that allows two free bags, while others charge for each one. SWA pretty much rules the roost at Midway...they became the big dog when Peoples Airlines and then Midway Airlines foundered...as for now, it looks like SWA is set up to be king for quite a long time.

SWA does a lot of little things very well. First of all they fly only Boeing 737s...that means they only have to inventory one set of replacement parts, thus lowering their costs. They also don't fool with assigned seating...they have a different program that rewards early reservations. They have a great website that is easy to run through, and they have a nice Rewards Program that awards free flights to frequent users. All told, SWA runs a nice airline and they don't waste time with stuff that doesn't make the airline run better...such as in-flight meals.

Southwest has a sort of democratic boarding process. While it used to be by when you arrived at the gate, it changed to one where you get a boarding pass enumerated by when you bought your seat...once again planners make out well. You can also purchase an early boarding pass for less than $20 that gets you in the lottery before the great unwashed. The earlier you book the better your boarding position, unless you pay the higher prices and get first seating. So all-in-all, reserve early and pay the extra $20 or so for early seating...you won't be sorry. Highly recommended commuter type airline...they fly everywhere and they fly full, so reserve early."|southwest

The flight crew is always friendly, polite and helpful.  Their website is very user friendly.  I love getting the business select tickets whenever I have to travel for work.  It gives you the most rapid rewards points out of all the tickets that you can purchase, you get assigned priority boarding in the ""A"" group, your ticket is refundable, AND you get a free DRANK on the plane!  I loooove FREE and I looove DRANKS!

I just recently traveled using Southwest out of Midway Airport (MDW) and out of the Cincinnati Airport (CVG).  Both experiences were a 5 star experience.  With other airlines in the news recently for dragging people off the plane, I just want an airline that I can rely on.  Southwest is the one!"|southwest

Due to mechanical issues our flight from nyc was cancelled, we could not get another flight until the next day.

We were told that it was not their responsibility to get us a place to stay even though it was their fault.  

After talking to SWA numerous times, swa has taken no responsibility and have offered no compensation.  Avoid this airline.  They will abandon you and not think twice about it."|southwest

I wanted to say the service in the flights and PERSONALITIES of the flight attendants are awesome. They all seem to work well as a team at trying to bring humor and enjoyment to each of us. Tonight's flight from San Diego to St. Louis was no different from the funny tag lines describing safety features to a hilarious Happy Birthday announcement to a 50 year old passenger. This came equipped with a mocked up happy birthday hat and candles made of straws. We sang happy birthday to this guy who will always remember who put them up to it. Thank Southwest for always getting us to our destination.|southwest

Sometimes cheap isn't always a better option i font care if two back does fly for free. Safety should be everyone's main concern. On the returning flight it was delayed (flight 2285 June 3) supposedly leaving at 6:15 arriving to chicago at 7:15 the flight didn't board until 7:15.

The reviews seem pretty all across the board, but it seems like you either love Southwest or hate them, and I assume those that lean towards a one star review have had a bad flight or bad customer service. I for one, have always had a great experience with Southwest Airlines.

The flight attendants are always nice and accommodating and we've even had a handful that are pretty funny too. I actually like the fact that you get to choose your own seat and the boarding process always seems to work out really well, although there's always a few people who take their line in order WAY too seriously. For the most part though, I like this system and appreciate that you don't have to pay extra to get a decent seat.

Bags fly free which is another bonus! They are continually increasing their travel cities and a few years ago Southwest even added a direct flight to Aruba which is a favorite vacation spot of ours. My husband always gets free drink coupons in the mail, which makes our flights that much more fun with a cocktail in hand. Even without the drink coupons, cocktails are $5 which isn't bad at all.

Overall, I think it's a great airline that continues to provide a comfortable, affordable, and safe travel experience!"|southwest
978|"*Attention*

(This review does not directly reflect the quality of the actual airline experience but reflects the integrity of the promotional / customer service department)

Anyone that is seeking to buy tickets online and are thinking about applying for the Southwest Credit Card, DON'T! 9x out of 10x they will not honor the promotion and will NOT giving you $200 off when purchasing tickets after applying and being accepted. It is just a scam to get you to open a credit card.

You might was well use your own bank card. I applied (with great credit) and suggested friends and families (who also have great credit) to apply and none of us got the $200 off! Sure, the only reason I applied was to save, who wouldn't?!

When I called to address the issue the lady I spoke to response was ""it is what it is"" and did not look to resolve the issue or provide comfort. So, if you are someone that is being enticed by the $200 off, DO NOT FALL FOR IT! You're not getting that $200 off now or later, sorry.

As for the flight experience... it's smooth, no issues there."|southwest
979|My friends and I decided to go on our very first vacation and I made tue mistake of booking through southwest airlines. We were supposed to leave at 11 a.m. on Sunday and arrive in vegas around 6 pm that evening. We arrived at 9 a.m. and they told us (not asked) that they changed our flight to go to chicago then vegas instead of pheonix to vegas. We said we wanted to stay woth the pheonix flight despite the delays because Chicago had a snow storm. They refused so we flew to Chicago in the start of our 26 hours of complete Hell. First we couldnt land in Chicago because as we told the man who refused to change our tickets back, there was a storm so we rerouted to indianapolis and sat on a plane for more than five hours landed and waiting. We get off the plane and before we get back to the gate they tell us we are flying back to Chicago. I wait in line for over an hour and a half to FINALLY get a way to vegas. They would fly us to South Carolina, Nashville, and finally Vegas. Well we arrive in South Carolina, the opposite side of the country and change flight crews. They ask where we are headed and tell us they cancelled our vegas flight so nashville is the last stop. We lost it. I was sobbing with distress. We didnt get a layover to eat all day and now the hotel I booked, treadure island, a whole day paid for and wasted. That alone is about $170 thrown away. Not to mention the $300+ i spent on our tickets to get there. So now starving, we wait 45 minutes to then be told we are stuck in Nashville over night and they refuse to get us a place to stay. So we all are all hungry and cry ourselves to sleep on the dirty floor. Morning comes and the crew isnt ready so now our san Diego flight is delayed. When we FINALLY board we are more than an hour late. Then they land at the wrong gate, woth with 15 minutes to catch our flight to vegas we have to go through TSA again because san Diego has you go through security when switching terminals only to make it by the skin of our teeth and arrive in Vegas 26+ hours late and so exhausted we couldnt enjoy what little time we had left of that day. This was our first vacation ever in all our lives. It was mine and my friends birthday celebration. I would soonee drive anywhere I go than take south west airlines. After asking for a refund for just the flight, not the missed hotel stay or event tickets we wasted, they refused and only offered us a credit. I would suggest avoid this company at all costs. Any other airline WILL refund your ticket when they screw up this badly. Southwest will have you spend over two hours waiting for them not to help you. Buyer beware|southwest
980|"Over the past 2 years the inbound bagage handling has become ridiculous. When you arrive at other SW destinations you can look at the plane windows and see bagage trucks arriving to start the process. SW Chicago to you have KPI that measures time from plane arrival to baggage on the baggage belts?
42 min tonight"|southwest
981|I feel when rating a service such as an Airline that you have to compare actual experience with other Airlines. Hands down my expectations have been exceeded by Southwest for over 10 years. All aspects of this business : website, fares, customer service, boarding, in flight, rewards program and baggage retrievals are unrivaled. I tell anyone that will listen if you have the choice you should try Southwesr, the service will make you a believer. Thank you SW.|southwest
982|I love SWA.  Most times you can find some airfare deals if you know how to search and be flexible.  The staff are generally friendly and cool. The only issue I have with them is retrieving your luggage.  This time the carousel changed twice and was slow.  We had to wait at least 23 minutes.  I hope they are able to fix this issue.|southwest
983|"Can't believe that I forgot to leave a review for Southwest Airlines!!!

In November 2017, I had to fly to Dallas for a conference. Now mind you, I'm 45 years old and this is only the second time I've ever been on a plane. The crew was attentive, helpful, and very funny. Pre-flight, it was easy to get through the lines since I had already checked in early. When I got to Dallas, the SW staff on the ground were nice enough to guide me through Love Field Airport to the shuttle bus for the car rentals.

The flight back home was great also. The crew wasn't as engaging as the crew I had going to Dallas, but they were still good.  Overall, I see why so many people like Southwest Airlines.  I'm definitely a customer from here on out!!"|southwest
984|"I use Southwest as often as I can.  My flyer mileage racks up with my points credit card and I love free flights!!

Tickets are always reasonable. And Midway International Airport is a lot easier than Ohare International."|southwest
985|Southwest is by far one of my favorite airlines. It's a no fuss airline that still maintains great customer service and hospitality at no additional cost. The ability to have a personal and a carry-on at no fee is rare. If you download the app it's incredibly easy to both check in and change your flight for no fee. Most folks don't like the choose your own seating set up but you get on the plane THAT much faster. Which means I get to my destination on time! Southwest will always be my go-to and I hope they add more direct routes as time goes on.|southwest
986|Horrible customer service!  Staff needs to be re-trained to be more welcoming and helpful.  Took my family to SW airport in Chicago staff were unfriendly and looked like we were bothering them.  When my family reached their destination at Dallas the SW staff were very friendly and helpful, what a difference.  Great job SW Dallas staff.|southwest
987|I have always loved southwest and even have a credit card through them. My last experience, however, was terrible. I had a flight with a connecting flight that were both delayed. However, when I got to the airport, the second flight was moved back to on time, which was an hour ahead of the stated time. I was moved to another flight. My bags however, were not moved. I was told I would need to come back to the airport the following day to pick them up and that they could not be moved. The other plane was not even at the airport and my bags were still at the airport. I live an hour away and all of my belongings were sent somewhere else. I was also moved to C66 on the new flight when I previously had a B boarding pass for my scheduled flight. There was no explanation for anything and the new flight was also delayed. I might need to rethink flying with this company again.|southwest
988|"So imagine going away on vacation and while at your destination, you make an attempt to check into your flight to return you home so you can get back to work. I have to earn the money I just spent on airfare. Except there's an enormous glitch. The return was cancelled. Upon checking in for my return flight, the instructions simply read, ""Check in at the airport"". What it fails to say is that there's no longer a plane for you.

Ok, so look. I know the Super 8s we're grounded and passengers need to remain flexible. However, the grounding took place a week and a half ago. My flight was cancelled before I ever left. Did anyone from the airline mention this? No. And why did they neglect to communicate this valuable piece of information to their passengers? Excellent question. It's absolute neglect and irresponsible to make the paying customers play the airplane lottery with respect to getting back home.

Had Southwest been honest and communicated in advance, I would have been able to make a decision, before leaving my state, if I were going to have difficulty getting home in time for my obligations. They say I was sent a text message while on my trip, after they had already taken my airfare and delivered me to my destination with a sketchy chance to get back home as planned and knowing there was no plane available to accomplish this. The reality is, no text message ever arrived. No email. No phone call. No nothing.

Had I followed instructions to go to the airport to check in, rather than calling to ask why I was having a Jaime checking in, every flight all day was completely booked until a flight at 8:30 that evening. You think I'm pissed off now, have me sitting in an airport for 13 hours with no flights to get home. I'd be outside of myself, angry.

So now I'm rebooked, thanks to my being proactive and not the airline, and I'm at the end of the C group, which assures everything will be checked but I should be thankful I ignored Southwests request to just show up at the airport and deal with it by calling and gobbling up one of the few seats left. While grossly inconvenienced and bitterly upset at how they handle this customer service event, I should feel fortunate I have a reservation. I can only hope SW doesn't cancel this flight too and bump me into next week.

The takeaway from all of this is as follows:
1. The airline handled the situation horrifically by being reactive and not proactive.
2. The customer representative just said again and again, I'm sorry but was unimpowed to do anything at all to compensate for the frustration (preboarding, extra points, a travel voucher... nothing).
3. 10 days ago, planes were grounded that customers had paid for flights to be on. This is ample time to develop alternate planning and notify passengers to let them know that travel plans may be iffy or completely cancelled. Did Southwest truly believe that by doing nothing, the situation would just go away on its own? That's a pathetic business plan and the loss becomes that of the paying customer.
4. Southwest has zero alliances (according to the customer service agent). This renders them completely unable to book on another airline in the event something goes wrong.
5. It's great that Southwest offers competitive airfares but there's an adage when consumers try and save a few bucks, ""You get what you pay for.""

Lesson learned!"|southwest
989|"South west is just ok for domestic flights..

The funny thing: I asked the ticket counter guy to give me sits at the front, he said I have to pay $40 extra to sit in the front . This is not ethical and good busnies for the customer. This is a cheat and making you pay extra money when you have no choise..

Nothing extra ordinary, just a regular flight company that flies around the states . While we are waiting to to board there is no information at all what time the boarding start or etc..

Onboard it was ok, funny flight attendants are making the the time passes . The sits are not the comfortable but it's ok for 2:30 minutes. The room for legs are pretty good companies the other flights that I had .  Definitely good room for legs makes you feel more comfortable. You can move your legs easy up and down:) yeah it's funny but for a flight of 2:30 minutes you need to move your legs.

They charge for alcohol or drinks,but water is free

I bought the tickets about 2 months ahead and cost me 210 for round trip to Chicago, so I guess it reasonable price .."|southwest
990|"Crew Laughed at Physically Impaired and Elderly Passengers Refused Basic Assistance...Putting Other Passengers at Risk!

Wish I could give zero stars. Upon boarding a passenger explained they had a neck/back injury and need assistance getting 1 bag (a light plastic roll case) into the overhead. It was clearly stated that the crew was not expected to lift the bag by themselves and that the passenger just needed an extra set of hands to help get the bag overhead and into the bin. The crew member responded that if they had a bag then they would have a back and neck injury too and couldn't come to work...and then LAUGHED at the passenger, then said someone would be there to assist. THERE WAS ZERO ASSISTANCE!
The passenger stumbles to get the bag up, if a kind hearted passenger didn't stand up to help, that case would've fallen on passengers heads! The helping passenger could be heard saying they overheard the conversation asking for help and Southwest was not proper about it.
The other two passengers in my party were in the same position except they were elderly (70 and 88 years old) one, less than a year out of hip replacement surgery and the other on 2 knee replacements. One c-pap machine and each with one bag for the overhead (these weren't heavy items!!!). Again...ZERO ASSISTANCE.  
Employees not wanting to risk themselves lifting passengers overstuffed bags into ther overhead alone is one thing, but putting multiple passengers at risk with this level of incompetency and disregard for public safety when people that very obviously need basic assistance are laughed at and ignored while specifically not asking you to lift their bag all by yourself is unforgivable. I have never seen a worse airline than this.

(FYI checking our bags was not an option with the trip to the baggage claim being more dangerous for the fall risk elderly passengers in my party.)

The crew member that laughed needs to be fired, there are so many competent people that would love that job."|southwest
991|"Once again Southwest delays and delays their New York to Chicago flight. it's now expected in at 12:30 AM but they continue to delay and threats of canceling. It's absurd.
Why offer a flight to arrive at 10:30  and not capable of fulfilling. Has happened too many  times. I'm giving up on them."|southwest
992|"I'll start by saying this is my first time with Southwest Airlines.  Things started off good with the low fares... But then became obvious why these fares were so low.  The customer service is the WORST.
The lady at the terminal counter started off by ignoring my existence as I stood and waited for acknowledgement so I could approach and ask my question.  She then called over another gentleman who had not been anywhere near this line and began to speak to him about his question. I approached the desk as they were speaking to see why I had been ignored. She looked at me as if I had killed her childhood dreams.  I asked my question slightly pissed off at this point. She then attempted to answer it with little to no help as if she was as well trained as a circus monkey.

The second incident of lack of professionalism comes from the other counter lady, who also ignored me as if her Google search was the one paying her for her services. She was speaking with another employee.  As this employee began to leave the terminal she decided to use the PA system to talk to her coworker while interrupting paying customer for a non critical reason to ask her if she was ""going to attend it"". This lack of customer care is something you'd expect at Walmart not an Airline.

Update: broke my suitcase ($180 if not more) told me it still rolls and stuff won't fall out so it's not a file-able report. F*cking kidding me?!? You broke my bag!!!!

Needless to say I won't be using this airline again. Only reason you get any stars is for cheap prices.  If I could take stars away I would."|southwest
993|"My flight was a few minutes behind schedule. Prior to boarding the costumer service representative asked for volunteers to check their bags since the flight was full. Only a few volunteered. Another call went out warning those in the ""b"" and ""c"" boarding groups that overhead space would be very limited and requesting more volunteers to check their bags.

Luckily I only had my laptop bag with me. I found my seat and placed my laptop in the overhead bin. Amazingly the passengers boarding last came on with huge carry luggage and overstuffed backpacks. As the flight attendants scrambled to find space for them, one attendant took my laptop bag out of the overhead space and stuffed in a carry on bag.

She asked if the laptop bag was mine. I said yes and she said there was space in the back of the plane. Since I was in the middle of the plane I told her to give it to me and placed it under the seat in front of me.

By placing my laptop bag in the back, I would not be able to keep an eye on it and I would I have to wait for everyone to get off the plane before retrieving my bag.

So I end up losing what little leg room given to me and am denied the right to place my bag in an overhead bin. This is the second time something like this has happened to me on a Southwest flight. Never experienced this when flying United or Delta.

Lesson learned. Good bye Southwest."|southwest
994|Went to Las Vegas it was a pleasant flight going and coming.  I love Southwest they are accommodating and a  pleasant experience|southwest
995|Getting REALLY tired of SW's policy on preboard !  As a A-list preferred customer I have HAD it with 1) completely able bodied people abusing this well intentioned step for those who TRULY require this!  Sadly, it has become an abuse by many!  Tired of it!  THEN, the flight crew on board allowed them today to walk right back to the emergency exit rows !  Thanks for NOTHING to all your loyal A list and A list preferred customers!  Mdw to Dal today- flt 2513 - signed a fed up A list preferred customer|southwest
996|Love southwest never have had a problem with them. They are always my first choice of airlines!|southwest
997|"Gotta fly with someone. Depending on where you go you don't always have a ton of options.

Wouldn't say SW is an international airline although they have recently added a few routes. They hedged their bets well purchasing fuel at a cheap price. So the two bags free worked well for them. Like the whole Subway $5 footlong bit. In the next year or so that'll change since the contract is up so it will be interesting to see what things change.

They only fly 737s like Alaska airlines so I hope you're into that aircraft. Still most of the fleet has been remodeled if not new so don't worry about a crusty plane. Seats actually recline. Tray tables are real (I'm looking at YOU Frontier!)

They do Coke products like many other companies. They do carry Dr. Pepper and Diet Dr. So that's a plus if you love that. Canned water not bottled. Pretty good about cocktails mixing them correctly and drink coupons here and their for regulars. I've even had many a free drink, not flying on a holiday, so thank you to their FAs.

Seattle to Denver SW is awesome. Seattle to Chicago also. Taken them over to Florida as well as Texas. Otherwise can't say much on the international routes. But for the price, destination options, and arrival and departure options this is a good cheaper airline that doesn't completely nickel and dime you."|southwest
998|Worst checked baggage wait times in the industry.  The waits at Midway airport are horrible.  It's so disappointing since at other airports they are efficient.  Here at Midway they are beyond awful.   Wait and wait and wait.  It's insane.  They should add 45 minutes time to every arriving flight.|southwest
999|Worst checked baggage wait times in the industry.  The waits at Midway airport are horrible.  It's so disappointing since at other airports they are efficient.  Here at Midway they are beyond awful.|southwest
1000|"Southwest is the best as I changed to earlier flight at no charge due to weather delay. Thank you to the African American woman at the ticket counter that did all this without interrogation, etc.

Also, I was dying of thirst and the Flight Attendant on plane gave me a can of water with no hassle.

This is service at the best."|southwest
1001|"Southwest lost my luggage from Columbus to Midway and sent it to Nashville. After leaving dozens of voicemails to their incompetent ""hotline"" I was finally able to get ahold of a seemingly nice women who insured me my bag would arrive at the provided address promptly, as I was 45 minutes away from the airport. After no sign  of the bag 5 hours later I decided to follow up, at which time I was informed no one would be delivering my bag and making right on the airlines mistake. Now I have to go and pick the bag up on my vacation for an almost 2 hour round trip. Southwest is absolute bullshit and does not look out for it's costumers whatsoever. I would give less than 1 star if I could."|southwest
1002|Very terrible airlines! They will lose your luggage! They have lost my luggage 3 times!!! They always lose luggage and that's not fair to the people who have to pay. Do NOT fly with Southwest! Their bags may be free to check... but they will lose it!|southwest
1003|"I have flown on Southwest at least 200
times. I'm not an expert yet but can certainly say that they are very consistently above all other airlines.
Best on time
Best trained employees
Best culture
Most diverse group of employees with one common thread- providing the best possible customer service.
They have fun!"|southwest
1004|"Not deserving of even one star!  what is this crazy process of boarding?  How are you supposed to sign up for the A list?  without paying for the upgrade?!  I just checked, $40 extra dollars to board ahead of the masses to get a good seat.  This is SO STRESSFUL!!  And we
re so far 20 min late boarding, and no explanation.  NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!"|southwest
1005|"Luv Southwest.
Luv the 2 free checked bags.
Luv that it is never over-booked (at least, that I have experienced).
Luv the $0 change fee.
Luv the leg room.
Luv the friendly service.

Take note other airlines - this one does it right!"|southwest
1006|Honestly your company's open seating crap is ridiculous!! Families that fly together ( especially ones with children ) do not want to fight other passengers just to be able to sit next to their child!! Not flying this airline again!|southwest
1007|"I had a very bad experience recently.  The night before my return home, they canceled my flight. When I called and asked, they said it was because of the weather. They put me on a different flight to a different city. Then, they canceled the other flight. I had read that they were having a lot of cancellations due to problems with their mechanics union. When I asked the person on the phone about this, she was completely rude. I ended up getting a flight back home on American Airlines. They had no issues with ""weather"". This cost me an extra $2000 for my family of 5 and unneeded stress. It's terrible that airlines can cancel flights at their discretion and lie about their reasons."|southwest
1008|First time flying Southwest and probably my last. They  boarded about 50 people and then said there will be a 90 minute delay and will not let us off the plane. The person I'm traveling with is not on board.   No phone charger ports and no service.  I've heard good things about Southwest but I've had much better experiences with Delta|southwest
1009|"Disappointed I can retrieve a receipt on the website.  Had to call customer service and wait for 11 minutes.  FAQ below doesn't work; action not possible.  I spent way too much time trying.
Also, no place to give this feedback on SWA's website, had to come to Yelp.  And no, I don't care to Tweet about it.

Can I retrieve a receipt for a previously purchased flight that I have not yet taken?  
Yes, you will need to go to the Manage Reservations page and retrieve your flight information with your full name and confirmation number. Click on the Resend Receipt link to have your receipt sent to the email address given for that reservation."|southwest
1010|"Our family friends were nice enough to work a Polish-store shopping trip into their weekday plans, so we saw the sights of Polish Village and Avondale and got a free ride to Midway to boot.

My flight was scheduled to leave about an hour-and-a-half after my parents', so I got to hang out with them in the airport until their flight boarded.  My flight would be delayed almost thirty minutes, but strangely, we only landed about fifteen minutes late.

The flight itself was bumpy but otherwise uneventful.  I was concerned about a crying-babies chorus soon after takeoff, but the tots got distracted or fell asleep, and the only other bothersome fellow passenger was a teenager who will suffer premature massive hearing loss because he uses earbuds but still turns the volume too far up.

My brother was nice enough to pick me up from Oakland after eleven, and I got to sleep at a decent hour (for me).

Thanks, family friends family!"|southwest
1011|Always wanted to fly Southwest because I found their planes to be attractive. Their fleet is impressive. We were on a Boeing 737-800 series. Very modern plane. Pilot gave us a heads up that the climb out was going to be bumpy. He was right to a degree, but honestly that plane powered through the conditions. An airbus would have been tossed across the skies. Not a fan of no seat assignments prior to boarding. And my wife was in the A boarding group, and I was in the B group and they would not let me board with her. But overall it was a decent experience|southwest
1012|"This morning, we woke up to a message that our flight had been cancelled. After we rushed to the airport, we were able to catch another flight. All flights at this point were going to delay our arrival until after 9pm. The attendant,  although not super friendly at first, was able to get us on a flight about 2 hours from our original airport with a much improved arrival time. We were even given travel vouchers for another flight.

....if we were given upgraded boarding position, I would've given 5 stars!"|southwest
1013|"Great airline. Always friendly and on time.
This big time business is ran so well you will find travel for business or pleasure a joy.
My wife and i travel once a month and cringe when we need to use a different airline.
Southwest is the best!"|southwest
1014|"Best airline. Respectable, reputable, allow two checked bags for free per person. They allow a lap child to be added and give the boarding pass anywhere. One does not have to miss a flight due to poor service like with United. And, they won't kill your pet, child, service animal, w
either. They do all of this with a smile and a sense of humor. We love Southwest Airlines. I will only book with them. Even a free flight from someone else isn't worth it."|southwest
1015|"This continues to be my favorite airline as far as service goes. They are even flying to Mexico and soon to Hawaii. For domestic travel you usually cannot beat it. The fact that they are at Midway is awesome if you live in Chicago. Much easier to deal with than O'hara. The employees who work here from those on the ground to the flight crews have always been funny and very pleasant. Other airlines could learn from this. You can fly 2 checked bags for free and 5 bucks for a cocktail!

The only drawbacks in my opinion is that there are much less non-stops than there used to be on this carrier. And most of those are not at the best times of the day. I hope that they add a few more based on that feedback. Myself and 5 others recently traveled out east and the flight options to main cities were terrible and they had many flights there but all were 1 or 2 stops which makes for a long trip. So much so that we actually picked another carrier out of O'hara for a direct flight with great times and much cheaper. Also their FF flyer program has drastically raised the amount of points required for a free flight. This is a major negative. C'mon LOVE listen to the customers!"|southwest
1016|Inconsistent, but overall my times flying Southwest have been fine.|southwest
1017|"We flew to Dominican Republic for a wedding and Southwest is our plane. Crew members were nice but we were all cramped up for the 4.5 flight. It was also a full flight. 0 leg room so you are very uncomfortable the whole time. They give you tiny chips/cookies and cup of soda or water. If you ask again, you're lucky if they don't ""forget"" about it. On top of that, they do charge for wi-fi! $8! How crazy is that?! So basically we were bored as hell the whole entire flight. We couldn't even sleep too, that's how much uncomfortable we are. How I wish we went to a different plane. Never again."|southwest
1018|"Southwest Airlines is pretty good! I like how the luggage is free. I also like that they are pet friendly, and the check in was easy for my dog. I am also pretty happy with their prices compared to other airlines.

On the other hand, I don't like how you pay for priority seating which is $35 each way. You are not necessarily guaranteed the best seat, just an order of when you can pick your seat. It is also potentially that you can't sit with your group.

The first airplane we took was a bit messy. You could tell the garbage on the floor. The second one was not bad. Though, they did make us switch planes after we had been sitting in a non a/c plane for a little while.

So I'll go with A ok."|southwest
1019|I refuse to travel any other airline if I absolutely do not have to.  Their prices are great, their customer service is great, their checked luggage rules are fantastic (2 free checked bags!!). I cannot thing of one bad thing to say about Southwest.  They have friendly employees.  Their flights are always on time and everything is just so efficient.  I feel safe while traveling with southwest.  If you get their credit card it makes traveling even easier!  Other airlines should follow in their path.|southwest
1020|I have always had a good experience with Southwest. The staff is very attentive and when unexpected delays, etc. come up they are quick to accommodate.|southwest
1021|"I have only the best things to say about this airline and no matter where I fly to or from I always get routed through Chicago.  Everywhere you go with Southwest the people are hardworking, friendly, and efficient.  I would bet that such great people are also underpaid.  

The only negative I'd say about Southwest is that in Chicago I have always been helped by people idly gossiping with their coworkers while they were helping me and I don't like that at all, but at the same time they're amazingly able to talk trash and help me at the same time.  Not everyone can multi-task."|southwest
1022|I love Southwest. Our credit card points transfer over easily for flight redemption, they really have an awesome crew, and who doesn't love their policies regarding 2 free checked bags and hassle free flight changes? I've only flown with other airlines twice in the past 10-15 years and that's because someone else got my tickets. Plus, they gave me 4 free drink coupons this past year! Love them!!|southwest
1023|Take a look at my bag. That is thick plastic. That is a $300 piece of luggage. It takes effort to do that. We went from LAX to DC to Midway back to LAX. This happened somewhere from DC back to LAX. No one takes pride in their job anymore. No wonder bags fly free with Southwest. Who would pay for this type of service? The bags were wet too when they finally got out on the carousel. What the heck are you guys at Southwest doing? I guess I should just be glad they did not lose or completely crush the bag.|southwest
1024|"Recently asked to leave a flight at Midway. The attendant
said: she's one of those"" literally behind my back. I smirked when I heard that. The pointed at me and exclaimed ""I saw that."" I shrugged figuring I was allowed to respond in a non threatening way. She asked to have me removed as I was ""unfit for the flight"".
I believe she was making an anti Semitic comment about me. I'm Jewish, 65 yo, 100 lb woman. I cowered in my seat and asked to stay. Nope!
I switched to American Airlines. Nicer NS flight- brighter roomier plane, with more room under the seats for personal stuff, and way better service. I find SWA attendants to be far less service oriented. And no NS cross country. And prices have climbed.
Worst experience to date.

1025|"After circling midway airport for like 20
Minutes waiting to land, we finally do. Now we've been locked down on the plane and they won't let us off. We are Confined to the plane. We've been sitting for hours already. It's almost 10pm, we are all  tired and just want to go home. Why are we being kept prisoner on this plane??? We have done nothing wrong to Southwest"|southwest
1026|I will only fly southwest if I have control of my travels. This airline will make you feel special and accommodate to your needs. You pick your own seats and most of the time the people are friendly. The flight attendants are amazing at their job and will help you with anything you need.|southwest
1027|Favorite airline hands down, I now only fly Southwest - even signed up for the dang credit card. I love that each person gets two free bags under 50 lbs and I always receive great customer service here. You don't get to choose your own seat but it's open seating, allowing you to pick wherever you'd like to sit. It's great when traveling with friends and family, less planning to do beforehand! Southwest has so many different flight options, you really can fly anywhere these days with them. Flights are occasionally delayed, but always for a legitimate reason and they are great with communication. The staff onboard is really friendly, funny, and at times sarcastic - good for me because I'm not good with flying. Booking online is very easy, and you can reschedule your flight without paying a ridiculous fee to rebook. If only other airlines worked as well as Southwest!|southwest
1028|"Now that Southwest is expanding it's operations outside the US hopefully they will rethink a few of their procedures and act more like a prominent air carrier. They need to implement some additional amenities to justify their rates Southwest is no longer a ""discount carrier"" I find the fares to be all over the place sure you can fine some cheap "" I wanna get away"" fares from time to time but they also aren't  as competitive at other times.

If you selling business class fares give me some business class service a free drink coupon good for only the day you fly isn't going to do it. Although I fortunately board between A01 and A15 most flight most of the forward seats are taken by pre-boarder that I'm sure have the ""I wanna get away fares"".

Southwest if you want to be one of the big guys start moving that direction you need to refit you first 3 or 4 rows to business class with larger seats in a two x two configuration reserved for business class.

Until then I will fly Southwest when my options are limited they will never be my first option."|southwest
1029|Love southwest. I can always find a inexpensive flight to just about anywhere. I love love the fact that they do. It charge for baggage! It's also convenient that I can always change my flight and have a credit for a different flight.|southwest
1030|Today returning from Tampa, FL to Chicago Midway on an earlier flight at 11:50am vs 3:35pm originally ticketed, we were accessed 57,900 pts to change to the aforementioned flight.  The original pts for the round trip were a little over 32,000.  We felt the desk supervisor called Krystal could have worked with us, but refused helping us out.  In addition, when we got on board the 11:50am flight there were plenty of open seats available.  We were very disappointed in SW for not going the extra distance to help us even knowing there was  plenty of seat availability and applying an excessive point penalty to change flights.  My earlybird check-in wasn't valid either, but still charged.  They failed us miserably...|southwest
1031|"BAGS HAVE FEELINGS TOO

Southwest loves your bags enough to let them fly free. Some airlines will nickel and dime you, even charging you to carry your bags on. What kind of Spirit is that for bags?

Southwest has low fares compared to everyone else especially when you take in the fact there are no hidden fees like bag charges or even seat fees. What kind of Spirit would charge you money to pick your seat even in the last row. It's just crazy to think of an airline charging you for a seat.

The staff of Southwest is amazing. The staff is always in a great mood and often playing with the passengers. I've heard full songs about take of and landing. Sometimes a few jokes prior to take off. My favorite...""We have a smoking section located on the wing. If you can light it, then you can smoke it!"" Just classic.

Many years ago on one of our flights my co-worker and I went from Dallas to Houston to Lubbuck, Texas. We had the same flight attendants for all the legs, so we spent time joking with them. We noticed the one flight attendant was passing out peanuts and saying to passengers, ""Would you like PENISSS!"" My buddy and I were laughing so hard, later in the evening we saw the flight attendants in a bar and we had to ask them if she was really saying it. Both started laughing and said, ""Oh my! You caught that?"" We all had a good laugh. See how much fun Southwest Airlines is! The staff can all have a good laugh. Life would be all better if we could just laugh at it.

In my 20 years of business travel I've spent a lot of time in the air. Southwest use to mail me out drink coupons all the time. I was always trying to get rid of them before they expired. I would often buy drinks for my row if they were cool. Hey if you picked to sit next to me, then I was going to reward you. It was a great way to make row friends and kept the Southwest party going. Once a rude person in another row leaned over his seat and said, ""I want a drink too!"" I said, ""Well you should have picked your row more wisely!"" The nerve of some people. I make my own rules on the free drinks row policy.

Southwest also plays by there own rules. In order to book low fares you need to go to their website. Southwest doesn't play the other airline games by also posting on other travel sites. There are just straight up giving you a deal. I also love how they give you options to lower your ticket by simply changing your flight to a different time.

Boarding can be a little tricky but once you figure out the tricks to getting your seats it makes life easy. The people that dislike this process always check in late and get to the airport late. If that is you, then I really don't want to hear your excuses about why you dislike Southwest.

I fly three main airlines: American, United and Southwest all in that order depending on arrival times and cost. Southwest has some of the best customer service.  They want happy customers and they do a great job at trying to keep people happy. Bags should always fly free and Southwest rocks for keeping this policy in place."|southwest
1032|Southwest for me, has always been reliable and gets me to the destinations that I am headed. The team was nice, the plane was clean. The seats are a bit aged but that's wear and tear. The opened the gate to board in the front of the plane and the back of the plane which made for a speedy boarding process. This was a first that I have seen. It works great and everyone was seated quickly. Thank you South West!|southwest
1033|"Buying rapid reward points is a scam! When purchasing tickets online, a message popped up stating I needed to buy more points to purchase the flight. A simple addition stating ""It may be less to book with money"" would have saved me $600. If you don't have enough points, check if it is better to use your points for one leg of the trip and pay cash for the other leg of the trip. No help from customer service. Shame on Southwest! I used to consider it a consumer friendly company, but it is not!"|southwest
1034|Southwest Airlines!!  Flying can be stressful but we have had nothing other than great results with Southwest.  The web site makes it easy to purchase and check-in online.  Using their credit card keeps us in free flights.  They have amazing fare sales and changing a flight does not incur any fees.  Bags fly free!   The workers at the gate are professional even during times of customer bad behavior!  Southwest is almost always on time barring weather conditions.|southwest
1035|Good airline, haven't had any issues as yet. They don't overbook so that is helpful when you need to be sure you can make it on a flight if you missed it.|southwest
1036|The open seating plan is a joke. Was recommended to me, will have to fly return trip but never again.|southwest
1037|Great company. They have great employees and treat their clients with respect. Further more they don't gouge you with fees.|southwest
1038|I always use southwest when I can for traveling and my experiences have been good but I wish they had more nonstop flights like they used to.  I also wish they'd stop packing ppl into the flights like sardines.  It would make for a more pleasant flight experience. The flight attendants are always nice on all the flights I have been on especially for the trips to Las Vegas which makes you more excited about going to Sin City.|southwest
1039|Baggage drop was a breeze! Why some people don't do self tagging, I just don't get it. Little or no lines. Friendly, helpful staff. The gate agent seems fine so far. I love Southwest!|southwest
1040|i luv swa.  i luv swa.  i luv swa.  i luv swa.  i luv swa.  i luv swa.  i luv swa.  i luv swa.  i luv swa.  i luv swa.  i luv swa.  i luv swa.  i luv swa.  i luv swa.  i luv swa.  i luv swa.|southwest
1041|"They treated me like gold, even as a non-rev passenger.  On a day when there were high winds in Chicago, they helped me make the rest of my journey home from PDX.

Great station.  Fantastic gate agents.  Thank you for clearing me.  Even though we had a diversion on the way to RDU, it was an awesome flight.  The crew was calm, kind, and patient.

I am so grateful for our reciprocal cabin agreements with Southwest.  Thank you!"|southwest
1042|Last 3 times i took southwest flights were delayed by 2 hours.  Then they let too many bags on and my small carry on had to be checked and i had to further delay my trip waiting at the bag carousel. And dont even get me started on the singing airline attendant. Just what i did not need at 10pm after a 2 hour delay.  This ain't star search!|southwest
1043|Best airline out there. If you want a great product at a fair price? This is your airline. Others just don't compare. You can tell the employees enjoy their job, and that puts a smile on my face and brightens my day every flight. Luv me some SWA|southwest
1044|"Cheap flights.
Rack up points.
Fly for free.
No fees.
No issues.
Free drinks in holidays.  
Trick or treating on the flight was a fun treat for the kiddos.
I really enjoy flying with Southwest Airlines. My family and I have been pretty loyal flyers for the last decade or so. I would suggest SWA for any traveler on a budget. You get what you pay for, but why not pay a little less get there on time and without much hassle?"|southwest
1045|"Can't have too much respect for an airline that would rather a plane take off with empty seats than allow you to change flights. They told me I had to pay $150 or else sit for 100 minutes waiting for the next flight.

I thought this airline was all about bend-over-backwards customer service. For something that would have cost them $0 to do they told me to instead take a hike. I fly a lot for work... Delta, American/US Airways, United... None charges for standby like this. Oh well, learned my lesson."|southwest
1046|I had a daughter who was traveling back to her home state on Sunday afternoon. I was greeted with the upmost care in providing wheelchair accessible to my daughter. She had never flown alone before and I wasn't aware of all the accommodations provided to people with disabilities. We were also allowed to accompany her up until she boarded the flight with her daughter. Then I found out that when she got to her home state she was also greeted by Southwest flight attendant and was given the upmost care until my sister arrived to pick her up. I will continue to travel on Southwest from here on. Thank you SW crew.|southwest
1047|Not mad just disappointed if I worked this slow and incompetent I would be fired get a fucking caculator your computer algorithms don't work|southwest
1048|"Seems like Southwest must be the busiest airline wherever they fly to.  At Midway Airport in Chicago, Southwest is the busiest I have seen compared to anywhere else.  

Upon arrival at Midway, there was a long wait of about 30 minutes before the baggage was on the carousel.   When we departed on our Southwest flight, the lines were incredibly long!!!  Took folks about 45 minutes to get through the express line.  About an hour to make it through the full service line.

Staff was friendly both at Check-in and in the air.  Seats are comfy.  Rates are reasonable especially for checking in baggage.

Would use Southwest again for a trip to Chicago if the prices were right."|southwest
1049|Always a pleasure to fly with southwest airlines.   The staff is always friendly, helpful,  and over all efficient.   The fares are reasonable and two luggage are permitted,  which is great!|southwest
1050|Customer Service Masters, no matter what state I have visited customer service is so on point.  I was so frustrated because I kept getting bumped I was traveling with a buddy pass. But some how the agent seem to calm me they were so pleasant and patient and compassionate both in Florida and Tennessee  . I couldn't even get mad at them for getting bumped.  I even considered working for them they all seem so happy|southwest
1051|Good price, friendly crew, comfortable enough. Musician friendly and great early boarding choose your own option. I lobe this airline.|southwest
1052|This air line is very good nice workers and very friendly I give this airlines 4 stars|southwest
1053|"My boyfriend and I had a flight canceled yesterday. When we reached out to southwest to discuss the issue their customer service was very helpful and did their best to resolve.
It was very much appreciated."|southwest
1054|Horrible airline.  Ridiculous no reserved seating policy and to make it even doubly horrific, I flew it out of Midway airport in Chicago.  What a nightmare !!!! Paid $100 to upgrade 2 to get on plane earlier than others - overcrowded, overrated, Underwhelmed with this airline and airport - will never ever make this mistake again. Bye Felicia.|southwest
1055|Always love flying with Southwest. I have not had a bad experience. I have never had an unfriendly crew member. Always helpful.|southwest
1056|I need to update this review to add that after receiving my complaint, Southwest customer service gave me a flight coupon of 150.00 to cover the damage to my vest. Southwest made the right choice! Thanks @southwest.|southwest
1057|My Lululemon down vest became wedged under the arm seat ...When the flight attendant lifted the arm the wedged portion was covered with black grease marks. Southwest should reimburse me .|southwest
1058|Free Bags! If possible I always go Southwest and whenever I don't I almost always regret it. They do things different at Southwest Airlines and different is good.|southwest
1059|I had an awesome experience from Southwest Airline last Christmas. I took a trip to El Paso, Texas and back. Both ways I was treated well. Thank you Southwest.... I will ride you again someday.|southwest
1060|"Had a great experience flying with Southwest.  And I highly recommend early bird check in. Its only $15 per person and you can board first find a seat before everyone else.  No long lines.

Seats are comfortable and we had 2 full fights both ways to Chicago.  Lots of leg room if you sit up front and had the pick of the seats with early bird.

Prices are reasonable and staff nice. They also let you check in 2 luggage per person NO extra cost. Delta charged us $75 last time for 1 suitcase."|southwest
1061|"Some people are extremely loyal to certain products. Coca Cola for instance, or a certain brand of toilet paper. I'm like that way with Southwest.

I hear nothing but bad stuff about other airlines (mostly through stand-up comedy routines... check out Eugene Mirman's open letter to Delta) but everything I've read about SW, with the exception of that super sale website debacle, has been glowing. I've had great experiences with them every time I've flown. I pledge allegiance to this airline.

I also like when they do their little comedy skits during the safety demonstrations. If the flight is full, they usually forgo it, but they're good for a chuckle when the seats are kinda empty."|southwest
1062|Consistent great service. Reliable. Hate to fly anything but Southwest. Keep up the good work in taking care of customers.|southwest
1063|No other airline does it for me. Southwest truly has the best customer service... if I'm paying for a ticket I'm not paying for my bags and that's awesome...|southwest
1064|"In efficient service when checking in large groups with lots of bags. A supervisor Colleen and her coworker helped the most, but still a very slow process. Sending a group through the general lines while all checking 2 bags, some over weight and being charged to the same CC just doesn't seem efficient to me.
This is the only airport and airline we've had these issues with.

If it wasn't for Colleen and the other supervisor it would have taken us days and been more work on the rest of our group. Good job supervisors"|southwest
1065|"Southwest Airlines is for me SouthFriends Airline from all levels since their inception, the way they are is just so happiness and cheers to all of them.
God bless Southwest Airlines.

Good Prices always.
Smile and Enjoy"|southwest
1066|What a great and wonderful place to work and use for traveling. The flight attendants are so wonderful. Great customer service on the ground and in the air I really love this airline.|southwest
1067|"I have to give a big shout out to the crew of flight 5031 on the evening of April 7,2019 ( I hope that's the right flight number) I had to make an emergency flight from midway to Orlando, my 2 year old grandson drowned in a pool that day, they got me on the flight ( unfortunately southwest doesn't have any special emergency fares and it cost over $1000) I explained my situation to the gate person , I was crying obviously and she came around the desk and hugged me and said "" no worries your preboarded , you can get on first and off first!"" The flight crew were just as amazing, as I was getting off the plane I got a hand written note on a napkin from the flight crew with $38. Cash for cab fare or a meal . How incredible is that! I hope I got the flight number right? Thankfully my grandson is fine and we all got to fly home 4 days later! I love Southwest and will not fly anything else! Thankyou!!!"|southwest
1068|My daughter flew in 4/21 and weather delays here and Minnesota put her about two hours late but worth the safety. Going back 4/24 they overbooked the flight and asked people to take another plane. She refused and for $30 more could upgrade her boarding pass to move up to 9 or 10th boarding position. Nice to know you can be legally bribed to get on the plane faster. Normally no flight issues but this time it was a struggle...no more snacks or food in flight. I think it dates me a little..whoops!|southwest
1069|What's not to love about Southwest? Their employees are always friendly and professional. They are always ready to go above and beyond to make your flight more enjoyable. It's my families favorite airline. I wish they would start flying to London then I wouldn't have to find another airlines when we travel abroad|southwest
1070|Southwest Airlines always has the best prices and the staff is always very nice. The last time I flew was because my father in law passed away. My family had very short notice and we were able to get a flight from Chicago to Atlanta for $58 each way. Southwest always has amazing deals!|southwest
1071|I have flown southwest every year for our annual family vacation but I will never fly them again! We landed and were forced to sit on the taxiway for over an hour because another plane was at our gate??? Or at least that is what they told us! So out of all the southwest gates at midway airport there is only one we can go to?! Goodbye southwest you just lost my business!|southwest
1072|I've had the least amount of problems over the years, flying with Southwest. And whenever a problem does arise they always seem to handle it with ease, and put the customer first. The cheaper flights and free bags don't hurt either!|southwest
1073|I fly SW airlines often and I must say I am never disappointed.  In my opinion  they are the epitome of what every other airline out there should strive for.  Each pilot brings his own personality to the flight, going to Dallas it was about cowboys and horses trotting (you have to hear it to understand), Boston about the city and where to eat, Las Vegas funny jokes and stories.  Each one was different and unique, and I got to say it makes me look forward to my next trip with them.|southwest
1074|Another horrible experience on SWA. Flight 3453 from ORD to EWR delays 5 hours  and now sitting on the tarmac 45 minutes after landing. Brutal.|southwest
1075|"Our flight was somewhere close to 2 hours late getting to Midway due to an air traffic control blackout on the east coast.  Southwest held our connecting flight in Chicago for a bit more than 1/2 hour so we could make our outbound flight to Tucson.  Kudos to Southwest for being customer service oriented!

Did I mention - bags fly free!"|southwest
1076|"I have using this airline since they opened at Midway. Now, that's a LONG time. I am amazed how SWA keeps improving service.
I like the Early Bird check-in! No worries about boarding position.
I love the check-in. No more waiting in line for hours.
I just love the self-tagging system!
What a wonderful airline!
I Luv SWA!"|southwest
1077|"737s
and
weird
seating

Southwest is a low cost, domestic airline that features well over three thousand flights a day across the country.  It has a fleet of over 550 737s of various types and since it generally doesn't leave the United States, the 737s are the perfect plane for the carrier.

Since the price is usually at least as good as other airlines and the flights are usually on time unless something unpredictable like weather stops them, its a very popular choice. The employees are polite and efficient and although the lines can get long, things are usually pleasant as possible.

One thing I do not like is their unique and bizarre method of seating.  There are no assigned seats, You just get on the plane and find whatever seat happens to be available. This means there is no guarantee that you will sit next to the person you want to and that you might be tucked in between complete strangers. So once the sitting is completed you will frequently see people asking to trade seats.  It seems an unnecessary complication that serves absolutely no purpose.

But even thought I don't like the chaotic and random seating arrangement I will continue to use Southwest because of the low cost and convenience.  The main hub for SW is Midway in Chicago and this is a place we seem to frequently want to go.  Southwest is a good low cost domestic airline that is really good at getting hordes of people to where they want to good with as much comfort and efficiency as possible.  It only they would go to a more conventional and logic method of seating."|southwest
1078|Always a great experience on SWA!! Granted I wish that they had not ruined Midway Airport @MidwayAirport by changing over all the restaurants and concessions to being managed and run by the airport because they are all terrible now, but that isn't SWA's fault!  Love this airline!|southwest
1079|Good prices, but watch the in-airport agents. One DID charge me for a 'lap' baby, for whom I had no ticket, and did not need one. It was unnecessary: 'Company (wo)man'.. :-(|southwest
1080|The flight attendants are always so friendly will never fly any other airline since this one offers great prices and two free bags what more can I ask for|southwest
1081|Southwest Airlines is always the airline of choice. Prices can't be beat. They don't nickel and dime you for little extras and they fly all over. I appreciate the flight attendants' humor. Our pilots have always been great about keeping us updated. The planes are usually tidy (I won't say clean because I doubt they have the chance to wipe anything down) but I've never found any trash or anything near my seat. Customer service is also very professional and helpful. I'm sure they have to deal with many a harried customer daily but they never carry that on to the next. Love Southwest!|southwest
1082|"Flying southwest out of midway is just fantastic! Especially if you're a business traveler. You can get directs to most hubs. Try to take the far left lane for security. Also note that southwest is usually in terminal B but really early flights (before 6am & some later flights) can be located in gate a19. Oh and both southwest terminals have McDonalds but B has Mannys! It's not the same as the chicago favorite but it's worth a try none the less especially to avoid those McDonald's lines!

Happy Travels!"|southwest
1083|Third world country of the skies! Terrible fucking airline! Never runs on time! Flight delayed twice in a fucking day!|southwest
1084|"The airline continues to decline into the cattle call company in the skies. Our flight from Cleveland was delayed causing us to miss our flight from Chicago to San Diego.

When I asked the gate agent questions about why and what happened, she was about as empathetic as a doorknob.

Southwest is now the epitome of a company of people that are just doings their jobs. If you don't like being in customer service and you project that in the way you interact with customers, you should find another job.

I used to like flying southwest. Now it's just painful."|southwest
1085|Pushed flight 2.5 hours, 15 mins before boarding. Did nothing to accommodate flyers. Making plans to never fly SW again as this has become a regular occurrence.|southwest
1086|"I don't always give airlines a Yelp review. Heck, I've literally NEVER given an airlines Yelp review. But my experience on southwest from LGA to Midway on this quiet Thursday evening was first class. There were a number of reasons for this, but particularly because the flight attendant with short blonde hair, pretty, funny in a sarcastic way, and friendly was just awesome and I wish all flight attendants were like her.

That is all, I hope her manager reads this and realizes she's the best and deserves a promotion.

Xoxo,

The girl who sat in the last row window seat"|southwest
1087|Horrible service. Flight cancelled and since I'm on 2nd leg of flight I have to deal with rebooking help at the airport. Waited in line for over 90 minutes to clear 15 people ahead of me. Feel so sorry for the hundred or so people behind me. Web site, phone service are USELESS. Never fly this airline again. They HATE their customers.|southwest
1088|Our flight 1269 on May 10, 2018 departing at 2:55pm from chicago to laguardia was canceled via a text message at 9am without any explanation. Southwest rebooked us to a 2:25pm flight from chicago to Dallas, Texas and then from Dallas texas at 6:10pm to laguardia. Our flight at dallas was delayed fornclose to 2 hours and because of our last minute check in we had sit separately. A 2 hour flight became a 8 hour travel from chicago just to go south and then once again to travel north. We were supposed to arrive in new york city at 6pm Thursday and we didn't arrive until 1230am Friday morning. We spent close to $80 on a uber ride from airport to hotel for a 20 minute ride. And we did not arrive at hotel until 1:30 am. We paid for a hotel we didnt couldn't really enjoy in a expensive new york city.|southwest
1089|Great airline,  Great customer service  and sometimes great prices and one of only airlines that dont charge for checked bags.only bad thing is they destroyed my new suitcase twice.|southwest
1090|"My family and I flew to Orlando for our Disney Cruise for Spring Break. All the staff we encountered at Southwest were awesome from the people at the desk to the pilot. Being that it was Spring Break the plane was full of kids. The flight attendants were awesome, attentive, and patient. It was my youngest (3) first time flying and it was a good experience. The crew passed out beverages, peanuts and pretzels which my kids loved. Only down part (and this would be with almost any plane) trying to squeeze into the bathroom with my toddler and keep him from touching the surfaces! The crew on the return trip were equally awesome and the cost of our flight was reasonable for the time of year.

Last, I love that all the seats are vinyl now. I saw a report on the news that talked about how little the interior of the cabins are cleaned and was sickened by the findings. I ALWAYS carry my Lysol wipes. They came in handy because the last thing I needed were sick kids on the trip. Keep up the good work Southwest!"|southwest
1091|My experience was very unpleasant considering the discrimination I receive based on the color of my skin. Drinks shoved at me by flight attendants and bathroom doors slammed shut as I enter the bathroom. I will not be flying southwest ever again, it's truly sad that they have employees that would do these types of things to their customers. Terrible.|southwest
1092|"Southwest Airlines to the rescue! I have flown with many different airlines, for leisure travel and for business, and none of them compare to Southwest Airlines. I have always had a pleasant experience when it comes to the entire booking and traveling process with Southwest Airlines. Whenever I book with Southwest, I always keep in mind that I get TWO, yes TWO, free checked bags included in my airfare. That alone is worth booking with Southwest. In Chicago specifically, we are able to take the CTA Orange Line straight to Midway, which is very convenient if you are working in the Loop and need to catch a flight after work. I have always has an enjoyable boarding and in flight experience as well; the open seating is a plus when you are traveling with just two people (a trick to get into the A or B Group, is to check in immediately 24 hours before your flight, on the dot). The flight attendants are always polite and helpful in all situations I have encountered. Regarding their Customer Service, I have never had a better experience than with Southwest Airlines. Due to a business trip overlapping my personal flight I had previously booked, I needed to cancel my return flight. They stated ""No problem, let me just refund that half of the flight cost to your Southwest Airlines account."" I do not know of any other airline company that would do that without a second thought. Altogether, I will always chose Southwest Airlines first when booking a flight."|southwest
1093|"First time flying out of MDW using Southwest. Next time I will consider purchasing the ""EarlyBird Check-in"" for all my Southwest flights. I was in the C-group flying out of here. I have to say there is definitely not enough seats in Concourse B gates. I had to stand. There were a good number of people standing or taking a seat on the floor like little kids in grade school.

Eventually it was time to board. Luckily I was able to find a seat on the fourth row near the front. I sat in the center which was not bad. The service was great on the plane. They sure did offer us a lot of snacks on our four hour flight back to SAN.

I wish the WiFi was free. On my flight back, I decided to just watch shows that I stored on my phone. Overall, I had a great experience flying Southwest from MDW."|southwest
1094|Start your review of United Airlines.|united
1095|"Okay, everyone has their favorite airline, they're most hated airline, and the airline that they'd refuse to fly if hell froze over. This review isn't to change your mind about any of those areas but to provide some details about the United Airline experience at LAX.

I'm a bit biased towards United Airlines since it is my airline of choice. But at LAX, it has a lot of convenience that not everyone sees.

1. The easiest convenience is the location. United Airlines flies from terminal 7 and 8. If you happen to look at the way the airport is configured for drop off and pickup you can take the shortcut directly to United. I know the naysayers will say there's other shortcuts but United's terminal will get you out of the airport quicker, no shortcut for that!

2. The terminal has been redone. Granted the gate areas are pretty much unchanged the ticketing, security, and baggage areas were redone.

Pre-Pandemic the new configuration can shift through passengers with ease. These days, it's hardly crowded.

Hope to see all you fellow travelers on my flight. Say hello!"|united
1096|This is not what I expected. This is a Reston why Americans are doing so poorly with flattening the curve. Yes, I have a choice. Yes, I could've stayed home and not conducted business....however, I thought that flights were participating in social distancing? How so? Flight is FULL! Every row you look has a person in the seat. When will we learn? #entitled #greed|united
1097|"Shame on you United Airlines! You charged me $125 to cancel my flight (canceled due to Covid concerns) just to return my points to my account. I thought you said ""no change fees!"""|united
1098|"I want to say that I don't know if what these airlines are doing is even legal. During COVID times- I was hoping guidelines would be followed in the flight- basic protocol.

Before entering the flight at LAX airport, on the outside gates everyone seems to be adhering to social distancing regulations. However, once you get INSIDE the airline- UNITED ISN'T ENFORCING ANYTHING. Every single seat was filled, no spaces whatsoever. They seem to be just keeping cheap flights so they can fill up all seats and make their money as best they can.

I have video/photo footage of the round trip with United (Oct 2020). EVERY SINGLE SEAT FILLED. It's a joke to hear them say that they are enforcing COVID 19 regulations. When we inquired United employees about the situation, they said they were not going against the law. THAT WAS THEIR RESPONSE. How is sitting right next to strangers enforcing 6 ft apart for several hours?

Other airlines are following regulations (from my understanding i.e. Southwest, Alaskan, etc.) while I know some others aren't. I'm sure Airlines are receiving some sort of compensation/bail out money (and even if they aren't these companies make enough money), so all they have to do is enforce safety regulations of keeping empty seats between customers to help avoid the spread. But even that apparently costs them too much.

The fact that they even deny that they are not following protocol is baffling. And clearly they don't care about it. When I asked who to speak with responsible for possibly changing this they said there isn't. But we could COMPLAIN to customer service.

Very disappointing to ALL AIRLINES that follow this behavior (because it's not just United). This contributes to the spread of the virus. Congratulations on your service where you clearly care about the people flying."|united
1099|"I think we're all United in agreeing that Southwest is a better airline than United and American. But this was better than most, of the American ones anyway.

United used to be one of my favourite airlines, but these days they've dropped off a lot.

It was always a little more expensive than Southwest, but usually similarly good, if a little bit more stuffy. These days I haven't noticed it being that good. They're definitely not my favourite.

I would give 3 stars, but the ugly baggage fees and extras are hard to tolerate."|united
1100|"We had a pleasant flight back to VA.

Flight was on time. Employees in the plane were friendly and welcoming. Seats and leg space on the flights were comfy and spacious enough. Snacks and drinks were provided. Restrooms were clean enough. We got great deals on our tickets, so no complaints here. The pilots did a great job getting us to our destination safely, take off and landing went smoothly."|united
1101|"Considering that for my entire ordeal all they gave me was 5,000 points for something THEIR employees failed to do.

On 10/4/2020 I tried to check into the United counter to bring my checked bag on board when the agent at the counter said ""my shift is over someone will be here with you soon"". I waited for a new agent causing me to miss check in time by 5 minutes.
The new agent refused to help me book a new flight or find a flight, ANY flight to the east coast (so I could find a connecting flight to RDU). She said she understood my situation but there wasn't much she could do. I didn't care where I was going, just upset because out of my whole family, I was the only who missed the flight & now had to fly alone.
That night I took 3 flights & spent more money than I wanted to be able to make it to my job the next day. Instead of arriving at 6pm with my family in RDU on 10/4 I arrived at 3pm on 10/5 alone.
Later I found out the United agent at IAH rebooked my flight instead of helping me find a new one. This ordeal resulted in me spending more money than wanted & food gifts in my luggage spoiling.
To reiterate: I missed a flight because United Airlines at IAH did not have enough staff. The agent left and had me waiting until someone showed up. Instead of helping me, the agent at IAH told there was nothing she could do. She couldn't help me find a flight or anything. Later, I found out out of her own volition and WITHOUT my authorization or approval she rebooked my flight for the next day.
I never approved to this and it was not what I even asked for. I asked if they could help me find a flight to the east coast so I could find a connecting flight to make it home. Instead of arriving at 6pm on 10/4/2020 I arrived home at 3 pm 10/5/2020. This was due to me having to rebook and find new flights home. United is saying this is my issue because apparently me missing check in due to an agent going home is somehow my fault even though I was in line."|united
1102|"12/29/2020 Terrible delay on flight 1887 from Denver to Hartford. Made us change planes and sit and sit and sit for hours. Terrible job by United.

They turned this short journey into a painful marathon

Sitting on the ground with masks on for hours before take off.

Minor wing damage from fuel truck. Oh we have to de-plane. Then new gate and plane. Now board and wait an hour for the fuel truck and the catering truck. Oh the catering guys brought the wrong size trays so we have to wait ""just a few minutes"" more for them to get new sized trays that fit this plane.

Just a comedy of errors ruining our night and the memory of this trip.

United Airlines is terrible. They failed us."|united
1103|Worst airline experience of my life! I'll never fly United again! Abusive representatives ...Naomi W. at LAX United baggage check was a bully! I'm truly appalled at the treatment and behavior...had to post this. Please don't be abused by this airline. Please be warned. Communist airline.|united
1104|Worst customer service on the planet! You will never get a refund. They just want your money and not to keep you as a customer like Delta. I'm thinking about losing more $ with United just because I don't want to fly with them. Unbelievable! I will NEVER fly with them again! Learned my lesson the hard way twice!!!!!|united
1105|"I will never fly United again. Have been using them for years and they have been steadily getting worse. Customer service is terrible, ,legroom keeps gettin smaller, etc. I had recently booked a non stop flight to Boston where I would be renting a car to drive to the Woods Hole ferry to board the ferry on my reserved time. I had to cancel the flight due to health reasons and when getting online to cancel the flight, I noticed that United had changed the  non stop flight to one which stopped in Newark with a 3 hour layover before completing the flight to Boston. They never notified me of this change and I not only would have been unable to get to the ferry for my reserved time,  I would not have been able to make the last ferry of the day.  
NEVER FLY UNITED!"|united
1106|Stay away from this airline. They employ mean stewardesses. Kim Moye-Reyes works for this company and she is mean, rude, and very disrespectful. If she disagrees with your opinion she will stalk you on facebook and yelp and say mean thing dishonest thing.|united
1107|"So I fear flying more than I let people know now that I do it a bit more. Now that I do I've learned to avoid Spirit air and with that being said I appreciate the service I get at United so much more.

Now the smaller plane I had to take for the second leg of my trip was scary because the plane looked old due to the paint it was missing. Fortunately I did make it to my destination.

Anyway I have no complaints whatsoever."|united
1108|Booked a trip through Costco, trip was canceled due to the closure of Italy.  United said no refund, only a credit for future flights.  United said they would refund but would not give Costco the refund number.....  No customer service skills avoid at all cost|united
1109|My wife booked our flight to Oahu in first class because sitting cramped for 6 hours was just not comfortable the last time we went to Hawaii and the leg room was so worth the extra money. The flight attendants were great, the only thing that I didn't like was that they didn't have any TV Screens on seats or any electronic devices to watch shows or anything else. I would think flying first class this would be available. We had our Electronic devices that we downloaded their app and were able to view movies and videos etc. but if we hadn't we would have been asked out. We were given a hot lunch along with dessert on the way to and given a hot breakfast coming back. Alcohol, soda, water and snacks are free. When boarding you do board first which is so convenient. Overall I think I will use this airline again if the price is right. I would recommend this airline but I will tell you that Delta has the TV's if that is an issue for you.|united
1110|"Although United has a nice terminal lobby, the terminal staff is just horrid. Attitude after attitude. I'm amazed where they keep finding these people who are supposed to be customer facing.

Also, I have no idea why but they make you combine your bags before TSA, which is silly for those who specially pack for TSA screening before combining their bags. If you're worried about people trying to get by with additional bags, just make them check extra ones at the gate... Oh wait, you already do that. So why?"|united
1111|"Today they try to save money even on the most basic things like the ability to choose a seat or bring a bad with you to the plain. The thing is nobody told me that if I buy a specific seat I can't change seat unless I pay another $100. What is the next step? How many breath you take during the flight? Do you use the light? The bathroom?
Flight went well. On time. The only reason I give it 2 stars.
If you book online. Check you know what you pay for. Also checking a bag is $35 these days."|united
1112|"Reason why I didn't want to check anything in. I had a few boxes of candy to give away for Christmas, they were there when I checked my bag in. Just picked up my bag from baggage claim in LAX and it's gone, been on hold for 30 minutes now to get this taken care of. Petty.....

I paid you guys $30 to jack my stuff..."|united
1113|Beautiful terminal and amenities.  Great United club.  Renovated upgraded terminal.  Good security checkin.  Only negative is terminals at LAX are hard to get to and travel between.|united
1114|"We are long-time UA customers - loyal because the airline has always treated passengers fairly.  We received multiple e-mails assuring us that middle seats would be vacant & social distancing would not be a problem. We arrived at the airport to find the gate packed & then announcements about the flight being full.  No empty middle seats & no row-spacing. Every seat filled.  They had us as captive by then since we wanted to go on our trip. We carefully kept our masks on & huddled together & were grateful it was just a 90 minute flight.
The flight home a week later was on a bigger plane & it, too, was packed solid! Again, huddled together & hoped we wouldn't be infected.
Many passengers were as upset as we were. We were all lied to. And, adding insult to injury, the attendant kept making comments over the PA about how we must be sure to social distance!  How we were supposed to do that remains a complete mystery.
No more flights till vaccine is in & no more trusting UA."|united
1115|I would think in a global Pandemic they would have a seat empty in the middle for customers not flying together I felt extremely uncomfortable flying from sfo to pdx on the 21 also keep in mind this flight had every single seat filled with a person no blockage of the middle seat to put distance between people  and I'm still extremely uncomfortable for my up coming flight this is the first and last time I will fly with United|united

1119|"United airlines and its customer service is rude, cold, and uncaring.

I bought a flight for my mother and I from San Fransisco to Florence for her 70th birthday. We were to leave in the middle of May. She is immune compromised so I talked to customer service 6 weeks ago and they said it's best to cancel the trip because of covid. At that time the us govt said that we could no longer fly to northern Italy. They said I should get a refund but that I would have to make a claim for it.  I did and just got a credit for the future.

I was pissed and could use the $10,000 grand because my wife is now unemployed because of covid.

My sister called me today (booked separately for the same flight) and said she called and got a refund. She hadn't cancelled and let United do it for her.

So I called and the customer service person and their manager where rude, cold, and uncaring. They also said that I could not get a refund.

So United can get a bail out and I can't get my money back.

I will never fly United again. And as much as I fly for work that's a loss of a half a million of revenue in a life time. Nice short sighted thinking.

Todd Hollow-Bist"|united
1120|United Airlines and its affiliate American Airlines are the worst airlines in the industry. They use to be reputable but now they are horrible. Their staff is rude and their planes are severely outdated and dilapidated. I would spend any extra amount to avoid flying with them. I highly recommend you avoid wasting your money. I travel quite a bit. Southwest is a much better option domestically and I would recommend Virgin internationally. Anyone but United. They are so rude and unapologetic about it. Also very inconsistent with their approach to policy. Seems like the go with whatever mood their flight attendants are in.|united
1121|Don't fly United airplanes unless you want to be packed in like sardines! They have no social distancing requirements other than keep your mask on at all times!  They give you one hand sanitizer wipe before you take ur seat & that's pretty much it. If you want COVID-19 fly United Airplanes it's gross!|united
1122|Had to travel during COVID and United is filling every seat. No social distancing. They say they are disinfecting the planes, but the guy in the seat next to me opened up his tray to find a sticky napkin. Feels like we're all at risk, including the flight staff.|united
1123|Mr. Tony the stewardess on united flight UA299 to LA from Houston.  50% of the plane was empty yet everyone knows that if possible as instructed by the CDC we should be spaced? he had all of us packed in like sardines in the mid-to the back saying something STUPID about the other seats cost more money??? Does united go out & hire the dumbest people it can find?? In a time like this do you think he could have used better judgment? I took a picture of his DUMB face & I am going to post this & the pictures of the empty plane so that everyone can see what an idiot looks when they're trying to be Arrogant. He may have put us all at risk if I contract the virus as a result of this I will sue united along with that Pasty skin, pudgy, thin hair SCHMUCK!|united
1124|Folks this is gonna be a long one. I would give this airline 0 stars, but in order to write a review you have to give it something. Can't believe I gave this place another chance. I get through checking bags and my first flight from Springfield to Denver with my service dog and no one says anything besides asking me if he is one. I get to Denver and all of a sudden his service tag no longer works, the fact that someone already gave me the go ahead on my last flight no longer works and $125 and after giving us one stupid tag to let them know he's had his shots (how would you even know that anyway with just a stupid tag?) we can finally board the plane. It's not my fault NO ONE from United put him in your system. I shouldn't have had to pay AGAIN for him to fly. On top of that, we get on the flight and I am sanitizing the seats and tray tables just in case they didn't and that was a good idea because they were dirty. Don't think the CDC would appreciate the fact your flight attendants didn't clean. Handing me a single sanitary wipe just lets me know I have to just take care of it myself. Also, just so you know, other passengers didn't use those wipes so....maybe you should also be taking care of it. I'm also calling corporate just to see if they care. NEVER AGAIN! I would've flown Southwest coming back had I known it would be this pricey. With our bags plus repaying for the dog, it cost us an extra $240 on top of $360 to fly. Southwest cost $270, and bags included. The only reason why I didn't fly them back is because they were not as cheap flying after the holiday and I was trying to save money. Man, I was wrong.|united

1129|"THE ABSOLUTE WORST AIRLINE COMPANY PERIOD!!!!!!!!!!!!

Check this out people.....Had a recent trip to Oahu. Flew Hawaiian Air on the way there which was awesome. No problems, free movies, drinks and snacks multiple times. Loved it!!!

On the way back had to book United as they were the only ones offering non-stop from Honolulu to LAX. Flight was supposed to leave at 10:00am local time. We started to reverse away from the terminal at 10:00 but stopped since there was a issue. After about 20mins, back on track. We reached the take-off runaway when the passengers smelled smoke/gas coming out of the vents. Parked to plane at the terminal again to be on the safe side. Waited for about 20 mins when we were asked to exit the plane and wait in the gate area. No info, no idea what was going on. We started getting text messages every 1/2 to 1 hr stating flight delayed to 11:30, then 12:30, then 2:00 then the flight is being cancelled at around 4:00pm.

1st and foremost, we almost took off with this issue that the crew and staff had no idea about until the passengers spoke up. And seeing that they couldn't diagnose the problem and had to cancel the flight tells me I could be floating somewhere in the Pacific right now if we didn't speak up.

After flight cancellation announcement, you know all hell was going to break loose and it did. People frustrated w/United as lines were long and there was only 2 reps assisting in redirecting people to other flights or hotel stays.

Long story short, we were booked on a 11:00pm flight not going non-stop to LAX, but going to SFO with a connector to LAX. I should have arrived in LAX at 6:40pm Wednesday but ended up arriving at 11:00am Thursday. BTW, the customer service supervisor(you know who you are) actually started yelling at customers. Great customer service dude! Makes me want to fly United again.  Instead of assisting, he made matters worse and then fled the scene.

Folks, I know United might be cheaper to fly. That's the reason I purchased their ticket. But, like the old saying goes, ""you get what you pay for"".  I WILL NEVER FLY UNITED AGAIN!!! EVER!!!!"|united
1130|"I REALLY WANNA PUT 0 STARS!!! I purchased a ticket for United Airlines to travel on August 17, 2020 from LAX to ORD. I got to the airport around 10pm and got my boarding pass and proceeded to TSA like normal. I was told I had a ""no carry-on"" ticket so I would have to check my bag. No problem. I paid for my bag to be checked ($35). I drop my bag off and the United worker told me that my bag will be going to Orlando. I said no, Chicago. He said because the flights final destination was Orlando then that is where my bag would go. I told him that MY final destination is Chicago so could my bag be sent to Chicago. He told me that they do not take bags off the flight when we stop in Chicago. (He was very rude btw + he lied. Pictures/ Video included) Ok. ""So what can I do for my bag to get where I'm going sir?"" He told me that I would have to upgrade my ticket. So I went and stood in the customer service lane. The time is now 10:30pm. We finally get to the desk and I tell another united worker the problem. She says ""ok we can just upgrade the ticket"" Ok. After almost 10 mins, she says ""you might as well just buy another ticket"" Excuse me? With the upgrade and all of their ""extra"" fees the upgrade total would be $800! $800 for a ONE-way ticket because I have a carry on bag?!? I said aht aht that is not right. Let me speak to someone else ASAP. The supervisor walks by and says ""whatever she says is what is correct. That's our policy. Sorry."" Wowwwww. So what else can we do ma'am because $800 is too much and my flight boards in 15 minutes? The time is now 10:45pm. She says ""you can pay the fees, leave your bag or buy another ticket."" WHAT? She kept asking me what was in my bag also like ma'am it doesn't matter what is in my bag, I need it with me. I'm NOT leaving it. Anyway, I finally say I will buy another ticket because at this point I'm going to miss my flight. She says another ticket is $498.10. Really? Ok so can I get a refund on the ticket I bought already since I'm buying another one? She says ""No you would have had to cancel the flight 24 hours in advance to get a refund."" So I'm losing the money on the first ticket because you guys refuse to help and I have to purchase another one? Alright this is ridiculous at this point. I end up buying another ticket for $498.10. I get on my flight and once we land.. guess what? They started to take bags off the flight. Wowwwwwww!!!
The next day: we call corporate to report what we experienced the day prior. The first person we spoke to was very nonchalant just like the workers at the airport. She wasn't trying to help much. She just kept telling us to go file a complaint. We asked to talk to someone else. The new lady gets on the phone with the SAME attitude. She says that they cannot help me because the airport wrote a note saying that I REFUSED to check my bag. Does that make any sense? Why would I refuse to check my bag on a flight that I am on?! Why would I purposefully have myself pay an additional $500 for a ticket when I already had a ticket on the flight?! Y'all full of shit forsure now. She says that I would have to go on their website to file a complaint so it can be investigated because they don't know who is telling the truth. Well it sounds to me like y'all believe what was said on the report because y'all not helping me at all but if United didn't do anything wrong.. why would they make a report in the first place? Ohh ok. The supervisor was rude just like EVERY united worker and supervisor that was working that night. Everyone was nonchalant and rude. No one tried to help us at all. The simple solution would have been to fix the bag slip to get the bag unloaded in Chicago. I paid for the bag anyway so what would have been wrong with that?
So I typed out all of this because they thought I was going to let this go when I was told to file a complaint. They were wrong. I'm going to tell this story until something is done about it. In my personal opinion, I was discriminated against. Nothing they did displayed good customer service. NO ONE cared. Everyone was very bland. I've never  bought flights through United anyway but now I know I never will and no one should. If you're not flying first class, the customer service IS trash."|united
1131|"Trying to make a reservation through their call center because we had a voucher we wanted to use and request. To sum up; we spend an entire evening on the phone, got disconnected twice, had to spell our names a million times (nope, not a weird name or anything) almost got charged twice, supervisor said he would call us back but didn't, and finally got it sorted out. And we just received the confirmation. They spelled my last name wrong. Again.

United's customer service is so horrendous that it's almost comical. Almost..."|united
1132|They packed the plane, not one open seat even thought they said they don't do that. Dont fly united. Flew to Cancun. They give you alcohol wipes which is covid safe BUT I feel that they should wipe the.plane down before we board. The smell of pure alcohol from everyone using the provided wipe was overbearing and filled the cabin. It's understandable but just an FYI for those that can't take burning eyes or has anxiety about smells that you can't get away from. Very sweet staff but the packed plane and thought that was against regulations so I'm not sure how they get away with it.|united
1133|I am very impressed with United Airlines and their response to COVID. Social distancing is maintained.  Middle seats are empty. You are handed sanitary wipes upon entering the aircraft.  The entire crew and every passenger I have encountered has been courteous.  I'm impressed.  I flew American two weeks ago and I was crowded in like a can of sardines.|united

Jose handled himself as one should when dealing with angry passengers.  I would fly with him anytime in this situation. To the lady who was so upset about the flight being delayed, i would just say probably dont book a flight on or near a deadline. Give yourself plenty of time if the plane might be late.|united
1137|"United is in the headlines again - good time to pile on! Flying to O'Hare ~3 years ago for $80 round; I had no complaints then. Ofc that was before they dragged an Asian man off the plane. This time I scored an incredibly low $600 deal to Guam! theflightdeal.com should be on your twitter feed!

Catches:
1. Connect through HNL there; and return through Narita (sushi!) A multi-stop was possible for only $60 more! The Narita connection necessitates your US passport. So be aware.
2. They treat both legs LAX-HNL and HNL-GUM as domestic flights. No meals, alcoholic drinks, nor significant snacks included. But they include one 50 pound checked bag. Profit squeezing antics. Had to buy overpriced food in the HNL airport - still better than the food for sale on plane.
3. Older planes on this route. Overhead compartments on the smaller side and filled up quickly.
4. No in-seat entertainment. You must bring your own device and install their app before boarding. There is no free download option while on the plane.
5. Full flights! For a hated airline, they get customers.

Website / Technology:
Their website is the worst; even the automated emails look like the lowest bidder got the work. Trying to print a boarding pass at home took multiple attempts - the site kept crashing. Even worse, the site proclaimed no seat selection was possible for the ANA return flight and only could be done at the check-in counter. Not true!!! You can select it by going directly to ANA's website. At least this multi-company integration worked. Luckily I had googled for this information and picked better seats in time.

Staff:
Some were okay; some were downright apathetic and dgaf-glazed. Definitely in the bottom of my experiences crossing the Pacific.

Entertainment:
Decent selection and some fairly newish movies. Didn't notice any problems with streaming.

Meh - United feels like the Spirit Air of the larger carriers. We were so relieved to be flying back on ANA. Much better experience! But United is the only domestic carrier to Guam now. Delta has left :( To avoid it, one has to fly to Japan or Korea then take an Asian carrier to the island. I'm seriously considering this.

In general, avoid if you can! Especially if you'd like to keep your traveling pet alive and not left to die in the overhead bin."|united
1138|"Just came home from a trip from LAX to Honolulu and there were two things I KNOW this airline can improve on.  First of all, I had to take a COVID test within 72 hours of arriving in Honolulu to avoid a 14 day quarantine.  The state of Hawaii only allows test results from very limited number of testing sites.  CVS stated that in most cases, customers would receive test results within 2 to 3 days.  On day 3, I still hadn't received my test result but decided to take a chance and get on the plane anyway (hotel was prepaid and non-refundable).  Several hours before my flight, I received an e-mail from United stating that if I didn't have the test results when I landed, I would be quarantined for 14 days.  This is not true.  I would be quarantined UNTIL I received a negative test result.  This erroneous e-mail caused me a lot of undue stress and extra phone calls.  I'm happy to provide the exact wording if anyone is interested but it is misleading and anxiety-inducing!

Next, I paid an additional $300 to be upgraded to Business Class on my return flight.  Yes, the seats were somewhat larger and roomier than Economy but the ONLY ""meal"" was an INEDIBLE ""turkey"" sandwich.  The girl sitting next to me couldn't eat hers either.  That was the most expensive turkey sandwich I've ever had.  Would have done much better to save that $300 and had a nice steak and lobster dinner when I got home!  Really United?  You can't have a better meal than that??? Yes, even during COVID.  I know you can!!"|united
1139|Agents are always super nice to us when we check in. LAX is massive and it's a headache to navigate but United tries to make it as stress free as possible when you get to T7.

1144|I would never travel this Airline again, My family and I was forced to pay $150 in total 5 carry-on traving in Charlotte NC to Newark NJ on Sunday Jan 26 2020, no the flight was not full there was extra seats on this plane I didn't even travel in my own seat plus there was at least 5 seats what I saw empty, not to mention the over head compartment lots of space remind you people aboard had carry on plus they was larger than mine by the there agent was rude he yelled at my 72 year old mother he yelled at my daughter and son which is only 15, he kept saying with our tickets no carry-on, Now these are the same 5 carry- on we traveling into Charlotte on a smaller and crowded plane. The These are the of 4 of my carry on|united

They suck !!!"|united
1147|"I was forced to check a bag at the gate due to a full flight while all of the overhead compartments around my seat remained empty.  Unfortunately, I didn't remove my laptop computer from the bad due to the last minute confusion that resulted in a cracked screen.  I called the airline to report it as soon as I became aware of the damage, but the claims process looks impossible...

Lesson learned, don't trust the airline clerks when they tell you that your bag must be checked...
I saw others coming on board the same flight behind me with even larger carry on bags having no problem"|united
1148|What is wrong with United Airlines? What don't they screw up? Even something as simple as trading miles for a short-term newspaper subscription is beyond their capabilities. I tried this about a month ago. The newspaper never arrived. I wrote to the United miles contractor who told me there was nothing they could do to ensure the newspaper would ever arrive. Pre-COVID I dreaded flying with these jokers and they appear to be one of the lousy merchants who incredibly got worse post-pandemic.|united
1149|"I don't understand why UA is only rated 1.5 stars my check in was so fast, the waiting area is full of plugs to charge my Iphone, this alone merits 4 stars.
I wanted to fly w D*lta but they were devious, it used to be 90,000 mikes for 2 round trips tickets, now they changed to 120,000 Miles furthermore they no longer post the mileage chart for award travel. United is upfront, all the terms are there for you to see, to South America bags fry free! I'm flying free to Honolulu for only 90,000 Miles n look this is the only airline giving you blankets! 5 stars baby !!"|united
1150|"Avoid at all costs.
Disgusting company:
Unhelpful
Liars
Cheaters
Thieves
Unreasonable
Unethical

They took our money without our permission and without any receipt!
They charged us tons of extra fees for ...checking luggage. and $150 for luggage that was 4.5lbs heavier, while 2 other bags were underweight.

When we tried to call customer service they took us on one-hour loopy drive. it was like talking to robots, not humans.

Soon they will make you rent your own seatbelt and pay to use the bathroom.

1151|"I was returning from My Thanksgiving-Holiday .. Traveling United Air-Lines from Mobile, Ala to Houston, Texas .. Changing to
a flight from Houston to LAX...

Well .. The flight from Mobile was Horrific .. It was a nightmare... Of course .. It was a very small plane & the gentleman who sat next to me was extremely over-weight...To the tune of 450+...I was sitting in the isle-seat...He took-up his seat and 1/2 of my seat...I actually flew from Mobile to Houston in half of a seat...I could not believe this was happening to me .. I was teary-eyed...

I ask the flight attendant if I could move to another seat .. And she said: ""No .. The plane is filled to capacity...""
Not apologetic  @ all .. Her attitude was if she could not have cared less... She was like .. Oh-Well...
However .. When-ever it was safe .. I found myself sticking one foot in the isle for a tiny bit of relief...

I cannot over-emphasize how much I understand that obesity is a health issue and this is the real world .. It's just that the airlines need to address this matter in regards to seating...""Know what I mean?""

Nonetheless .. A couple of days after returning home .. I reached out to United Air-Lines and explained the situation..

Glad to report:
Tiffany from United Air-Line In Customer-Care reached out & was very apologetic & gave me a voucher in the amount of $150...

Thanks a trillion United Air-Lines for making amends...

1152|"ZERO STARS.  Absolutely the WORST airlines I have ever flown. United airlines has been shrouded by a slew of bad press and media lately and you would think that they would overhaul their entire system and retrain their employees to rectify the damage that's been done, but NOPE. They are as shitty as ever.

I travel with two service animals and I fly a lot with them and have never had a problem with any airlines but UA had a problem with my paperwork so even though I checked in 1.5 hours prior to my direct flight from austin, Texas to Ontario, California, they made me spend over an hour on the phone with UA representatives who ultimately couldn't help and made me miss my flight. They made me leave one of my dogs Behind because they wouldn't let me pay for them either. Had to wait two hours to get a flight that had a layover in Houston.

The flights itself were turbulent and uncomfortable.

I also had a small carry on bag that they FORCED me to check in and pay $30!! What the hell is that?! And then they lost my luggage!!!! Are you kidding me??!  Took them two days to get my luggage back to me.

The worst part of all is that every single UA representative I dealt with were all robotic. Not a single person knew how to be listen and be empathetic. They didn't apologize for the inconvenience they put me through.

Do yourself a favor and pay a little extra to avoid this POS airlines."|united
1153|I booked an emergency flight to DTW on November 20th. They had assured me they were following all guidelines and the flight would not be completed booked. The day of I couldn't believe the amount of people that were waiting at the gate. I had asked one of the staff working the gate if all those people behind me were on the same flight as me. She didn't know how to respond only that I shouldn't worry because I would be safe. I didn't feel safe at all so I asked to be moved so that my teenager and i can seat together. They made it happen. When I boarded and got situated I couldn't believe, every single seat with the exception of a few seats were taken. It was a full flight. Flight attendants were not making sure every single person was keeping there mask on. I saw a few remove their mask from time to time. Honestly it was the most unsafe flight.  My connecting flight from Chicago to DTW was just as bad. Every single seat was taken on the express United.  I strongly encourage any one not to fly but if absolutely necessary DO NOT BOOK WITH UNITED AIR LINES!|united
1154|Not sure if this is becoming standard practice now, but 2 weeks ago alaska was not doing this. United is fully booking their flights and does not even attempt to space people out like alaska was doing. At least alaska pretended to care about our safety. Last united flight I book for a long time.|united
1155|Dont take United Airlines as long as COVID is around.  They seated people next to me, unlike all the other airlines I have flown on this year.  It's ridiculous!!!!  Their greed means they wont get my business, even though I have my frequent flyer miles through them|united
1156|"Canceled our March 25, 2020 flight from L.A. to Hawaii, on March 15, due to Covid19 concerns. (I'm 75 years old.)(Hawaii went on lock-down on about March 26.) Waited until April 30, then called the 800-864-8331 refunds number.  Had non refundable tickets. (The flight time had been changed then canceled.)  Got Desiree, who said no refund, only voucher. Cited Dept. of Transportation mandate and asked for supervisor. Got Kay.  I mentioned that we had another reservation for Oct. 2020 and would have no opportunity to use vouchers. She said that might be a recognized exception and she put in a request for refund. Only one week later than the 5-week estimate, I got an email saying that the refund was approved. Four days after that, I got my $925.60 refund.  This has greatly increased my loyalty to United.

1157|"Although I have flown with United domestically on multiple occasions, this was my first time to fly with them on an international flight and most likely, will be the last time.

On this trip, I was with two other family members. We tried to maximize the two check in baggages with 50 lbs limit for each. Most of our check ins were packed in recyclable boxes that were taped up heavily and tied with ropes.

In the check in counter, we were assisted by a lady who instructed us to weigh each check in baggage. Although we tried our best to weigh them before sealing, we still ended up a bit overweight by a pound or less. She told us that any baggage over 50 costs $200 each so she pointed us to the repacking area. Imagine the trouble we went through when we had to untie the rope, break the tape, and remove one or two shirts on each box which we ended up putting in our carry on.

We went back to the counter but the lady was gone so we approached a male representative this time who told us that 1 or 2 lbs overweight was just fine. So why the previous lady had to cause us so much misery? Why the inconsistency in rules?

The trip required a stop over in Honolulu. Some of the passengers needed to fill up a declaration form. One of the guys near me asked a stewardess if he can borrow a pen. She told him to borrow it from someone else because they don't lend pens because they were never returned back. In this case United, please let me know where can I send my donation for a box of pens?"|united
1158|"What a horrible disorganized nightmare!!!
Flew out on a Saturday night and it was a mess. People were everywhere and no one knew where to get in line.
Employees are rude, most likely from being under staffed.
Finally......got to my destination and unpacked my check in suitcase.
Bought a special gift, glass and mirror and it was broken.
So nice of TSA to NOT re wrap it the way I had it, but they left me a notice they went through it, I will be filing a claim!!!!!
All my clothes I folded so nicely were all wrinkled.
Will be a LONG time before I fly outta LAX.

LAX....get you s**t together."|united
1159|I have filed a dispute with my credit card company based on the fact that united changed the terms of the contract as it was when I bought the ticket. What united is doing is contractually invalid in terms of law. I recommend this course to people in the same situation.|united
1160|"I was also defrauded by United Airlines like so many others. They changed my flight time by 5 hours and when i called to cancel, they informed me that their new policy is to issue a refund if the flight time has changed by 6 hours or more.  At the time i purchased my tickets, their policy was cancellation and full refund if the time change is 2 hours or more.
United Airlines does not live by any business moral or ethics. Let's not forget that this is the same airline that dragged a passenger off of an overbooked flight while physically assaulting him. They are continuing their assault on their customers by stealing money from them.  This, in a time that we are all struggling to get through these uncertain and difficult times.  It is shameful, despicable and downright immoral. I will NEVER fly with United Airlines again - I would be willing to pay more for my ticket with another airline.  I would not support a company that lacks this level of integrity and engages in defrauding its customers."|united
1161|The worst Airlines on the planet. Do not fly them ever. I always fly JetBlue but for whatever reason choose United this time. We were supposed to attend my son's graduation out at the University of Colorado Boulder and of course it was canceled. So obviously we need to cancel our flights which were for May 7th. My son and his girlfriend were flying JetBlue for the same occasion. They canceled and received a full refund and United would only offer us a credit for a future trip. Short of money right now with everything going on while United gets a government bailout and you need to keep my money. Well go right ahead and don't worry I will never fly with you again !!!!!

1164|"The worst Airline the US has to offer. United knows every way to pinch pennies and precious time from their customer. My girlfriend and I booked a flight using Expedia and got Basic Economy (not to be confused with regular Economy). This is the very lowest tier that United has to offer. Here's a break-down list of useful information you should know:

1. They won't allow you to do a carry-on luggage. If you try, you will either be stopped at the security line or gate. My luggage with wheels was SMALLER than my girlfriends backpack, and yet I was still required to check-in my bag for $25! It's only because my luggage had wheels and not a strap to be technically called a backpack. Total BS. You aren't even allowed to purchase a carry-on price. You have to check in. I asked if I could throw away my luggage case and store my contents in a trash bag and she said yes. A trash bag would be considered acceptable as a personal item even if it's the same dimension (or even smaller) than your luggage!

2. You CANNOT check-in using your phone or computer. You have to check-in at a kiosk to print your boarding pass. Expect to wait in line, especially at LAX. They disabled the feature on the app on purpose even though it doesn't cost them any overhead. It's all for them to make money.

3. You will be forced to be on the last boarding group.

4. You will end up in the very back of the plane for sure. I had to sit right next to the restroom on the very last row. It stinks!

I'll never fly United ever again. There are so many other options. Why bother? It's not worth any price difference."|united
1165|Not safe to fly with United.  They still over book flights, I have a stranger rubbing shoulders with me for the next 5 hours on a full flight in the middle of a pandemic, why is every other industry required to social distance but airlines can put peoples lives in danger?  Why is no one stepping in to hold them accountable?|united
1166|"I want to give an extra special shout out to Clifton, who showed extra care and is Susie as him and made safety is the number one priority. During our visit. With professionals like Clifton, United Airlines can continue to be a Premier domestic carrier at the worlds greatest airport let's give a big ham to Clifton.

Unparalleled show  of customer appreciation excellence, Elaine R. went the extra mile for me and my elderly mother by ensuring that her address from the flight arrival gate all the way to baggage claim and she had a safe method of travel. I cannot recommend this domestic carrier highly enough, and I really like their new professional image."|united
1167|Worst customer service ever! Avoid this airlines. Flight delayed then plane change, went from first class (to avoid Covid crowding) to economy (smaller plane), sitting next to an obese woman who can't buckle her seatbelt, spilling into my seat. SFO to RDM. Take Alaska airlines instead!!!'|united
1168|Do not fly United Airlines again . I am frustrated with their customer service from over seas. I traveled to IAD had a round trip ticket , I had to cancel my going back home ticket due to some illness . They give me credit for $212 , now that I am ready to rebook my flight . I looked online choose a flight that was $159 , but when I try to book it and apply my credit the price goes up to the full amount of my credit . I thought they are saying no change fee . Why this miss guidance, why they are scamming people . I will never fly United again , they are ruthless and good to mention they don't follow social distancing , everyone is in the back seats while the front seats are empty.|united
1169|"YOOO THIS THE NEXT SPIRIT AIRLINES!! Or maybe I'm just behind the times and been riding Southwest and JetBlue for too long , because those airlines make sense.

I went on Priceline or kayak or some other popular airline ticket website, searched for the cheapest/ latest flight on a Friday from LA to Chicago and bought the ticket. I specifically excluded Airlines like Spirit because I didn't want to deal with secret ways for them to take more of my money.  I figured United sounds like a solid airline... Although there was the whole dragging a doctor down the aisle for no reason recently

Anyways I'm mainly writing this to warn future passengers that with a ""basic economy ticket"", which I guess is what I bought not knowing there were so many different tiers for travelers lol, you are not allowed to choose your seat or even bring a carry on luggage ( except for things like purses or backpacks that go under the seats). That makes this ticket I bought totally not worth it and I would have definitely chosen another airline if I knew this would be the case. I'M TOO BIG FOR THE MIDDLE AISLE!!

Learned my lesson. Take me back Southwest/JetBlue!"|united
1170|"This airliner is known for always having delayed flights, and today was no exception. 3 hour delay. I could have drive home and made it there by now had my bag not already been checked in. Gate changed 3 times and no apologies from the employees. I understand weather is probably an issue but why does it happen so often with United?

Also no free check in for military family. I have to be with my husband to check in the bag for free. I haven't had issues before with other (American) airlines. I am going back to avoiding this airline. The only reason it was booked was because I used a travel agent to help since I am too busy. If you can avoid this.

i spend upwards fo $3000.00-plus per year on united airline tickets.

every year.

while other airlines are issuing refunds when they cancel flights, you people are not.

how delightfully ethical to change your policies like a weathervane in a high wind, in your efforts to scr*w your customers out of their rightful refunds.

due to your apparent inability to grasp the larger, long-term picture regarding travellers, you are PERMANENTLY losing me as a customer.

or to express it in terms you might understand:

i have several decades, perhaps even as much as a half-century, of future travel ahead of me.

to put baldly & mathematically [and therefore in terms you will no doubt more readily understand]: you are losing, at a conservative estimate, $150,000.00-plus from this former customer.

congratulations!!

p.s. i really appreciate your coy text messages saying ""we understand your travel plans may have changed"". & you can take good-for-a-year [only?!] your credit and stuff it. i would like a refund, like pretty much everyone else.

p.p.s. i have filed a dispute with my credit card company based on the fact that united changed the terms of the contract as it was when i bought the ticket. what united is doing is contractually invalid in terms of law. here's hoping discover will prevail in procuring the refund! i recommend this course to people in the same situation."|united
1173|"With the negative media attention recently with United Airlines, I was curious how our short flight from LAX to Los Cabos would go.

The checkin was seamless, and all of the employees we interacted with were friendly and professional. The flight staff crew members were responsive and also professional. We upgraded our package included departure economy seats to Economy Plus for a small fee before the flight. The extra room was worth the price for us.

Our return flight from Los Cabos to LAX was also seamless. This portion of the flight we had economy seats, and they were fine. The flight crew members were also responsive, friendly, and professional.

The plane itself was orderly and clean, and the bathrooms were in good shape. Based on this flight, I would consider flying United Airlines outside of a travel package.  Another positive was the fact that both of our flights were on time!"|united
1174|"I have written about it elsewhere, but the saving grace of this airline is the free entertainment on their app inflight. Today was an especially good flight, as I ended up with a row to myself on the way to LAX.

The bad news is, I was headed to Montreal from SLC and had to go through LAX. For those of you keeping track at home, that is indeed an hour and a half (each way) out of my way. But that's the nature of the game.

You just fire up that app--be sure you have the latest version downloaded beforehand--and then there are movies and TV shows ready for you to watch. Just don't forget the headphones."|united
1175|"Had a  schedule flight from LAX to SEATTLE, a lay over flight to Seattle before Japan.  During bag check in @ LAX, Customer service rep at kiosk had said my baggage will end up in Japan(final destination) but she  was aware all flights have been canceled 3 days prior due to a deadly typhoon and she did not state. Was not informed by customer service rep that flights to Japan were all canceled,  so I flew out to Seattle and found out in Seattle by united airlines that all flights canceled
United airlines did not cover any further flights. ended up paying to fly back to LA. No other options were given by united airlines."|united
1176|"United at LAX may not be at par with international carriers yet, but they have stepped up their service quite a bit. The new premium check in lobby is nice and roomy. Employees are noticeably friendlier. The pre-check screening line moves faster and there is a new 'secret' GS check in that drops passenger right to the security conveyor belt in pre-check.
The new Club is roomy and has great views of the planes, better food and drink options and a terrace.
Remodeling in the terminal is progressing and will hopefully be done soon.
Overall, noteworthy improvements and on track to becoming a decent airline."|united
1177|"I booked a flight to Singapore from LAX with a connecting flight in SF. The plane had an issue where the door would not close so we sat on the tarmac for close to 2 hours. At that point they basically kicked all of us off the flight. When I asked about getting another flight they dismissively said go to customer service.

The line at customer service had over 50 people waiting & they only had 1 person helping. 15 minutes later....I was still in line & there was an announcement that the plane was reboarding. I was frantically trying to find another flight to Singapore & the next one wasn't for 8 hours.

I made the connection to Singapore by pushing my way off the plane & doing an OJ to my connecting flight.

When I got on that flight we were delayed again with issues with the plane! As I was sitting there on the plane I received a text from United saying that I could get another flight to Singapore because of the delay from the first flight?

The thing that bothered me the most was the lack of customer service! It was a very stressful situation & no one from United seemed to care.

All I can say is I will never fly United again. They really need to get their act together. Everyone I spoke to from the conference I'm attending flew Singapore Air & had a great trip."|united
1178|Had to cancel my flight due to Covid-19. Instead of giving a refund they give a credit...really?! That's pretty useless at a time where we don't know when it will be okay to fly anymore. Terrible airline, will never use again|united
1179|"This was my first time flying with United Airlines and on my own to boot.

They had a convenient check in stands to print out your boarding pass, scales to double check the weight of your check-in bags and printed out the sticker for your check-in bag. My boyfriend was there to watch me through the process, but we were unsure about putting the luggage sticker. Luckily, one of the security guards came to our rescue and got the tag on for me.

Then I proceeded to the bag check-in station and the lady who helped me was really nice and verified for me that my name printed on the boarding pass was okay since their system combines the first name and middle initial together. We walked s bit before I went through security check and it took a bit since the line got a bit longer by the time we got back to the  security area.

Once through, I made my way to my gate, passing a few shops and restaurants till I got to the end. The downside of the terminal was the outlets were more of a miss then useful considering they had so many outlets thrown around the waiting area.

Really enjoyed the setup of the plane and had a comfortable ride for the most part."|united

My experience turned out to be nothing of what folks were talking about. The flight was EARLY, and they did a good job of taking care of me during the flight. We got to my layover destination early as well, which gave me plenty of time to get some lunch.

1188|"Going into Norfolk was sort of ok. But coming back was the worst experience ever. No room for my small carryall on the flight from Norfolk to DC and then to LAX, so it was sent cargo. I asked for a frágil tag and was told by this banshee that they would put a fragile tag in my uber expensive carryall. That was NOT done. Gad, I hate being lied to. My carryall was scratched. The contents bandied about and squished. My seat on the flight to LAX was truly a nightmare of discomfort.  One inch of legroom.  And I'm 5'3"". The phone charger outlet UNDER the seat. No way to access it. No food -- just a small bag of pretzels and only your phone for entertainment.

United needs to pay ME big time to fly with them again and for replacing my carryall and the broken things. Very irresponsible. I dislike United AL attitude.  They take no responsibility for anything. Imagine that from an airline. Seriously.

1191|"Terrible terrible experience--would leave zero stars if I could. I flew today, August 27th, from EWR to LAX--purportedly a 5 hour flight. It took 6 and a half hours.

I am absolutely appalled at the incompetence of united airline and your faulty planes. My plane was supposed to arrive at 6:40 pm. It's 8 pm and I'm still getting off the place. This was all due to a mechanical error and it's your responsibly to make sure these things are taken care of so you can keep your commitments. Therefore, Because of a mechanical delay(YOUR fault--""unexpected operational issue""--not the weather or an unruly customer), I have no ride home and now have to spend over $100 dollars getting an uber.

Is this your idea of a sick joke!? Why your plane wouldn't be in working condition is beyond me. On top of everything, the flight attendants refused to let me stand near the door to send a text to my ride notifiying her I would be late. Disgusting irresponsibility on your part!

I suggest everyone reading this fly with American Airlines or pretty much any airline but United. Absolutely terrible!!!"|united
1192|Not Safe! Its very hard to do a 6 feet social distancing, which I understand, since that's the case let's get the flights attendants to do there job and Reinforce these passengers to wear mask on the plane along with keeping them on  throughout out the entire flight. if you not eating or drinking it should not just be over there mouth! I was on a small plane and I saw a lease 6 passengers with there mask off, mask below there nose, sleeping with there mask off, this is not ok!! Remember Flight Attendants if you don't have anyone flying because they don't feel safe that means it will effect your jobs (layoffs soon) so reinforce the rules you will have passengers flying feeling safe!|united
1193|"How the mighty have fallen.......if you want to take a carry on bag that fits in the overhead you need to pay a check in fee of $30 and or a gate fee of $25.

Can you say SPIRIT AIR?  What's next, $1 for water, $1 to use the toilet?"|united
1194|Onboard flight 579 from Chicago to Baltimore. The flight was delayed because of a loose panel and bolt that had to be put back. The flight has now been delayed for over 60 minutes. Also, United's seats don't have usb outlets in the seats toward the back of the plane. How is that even possible? Clearly United is a third rate airline and I won't be flying again and will be discouraging others from flying with them.|united
1195|After leaving a very emotional funeral in Belize Central America, my wife and I joined by 3 other family members started our return home to Los Angeles. The first leg was  Belize to Houston. Our luggage arrived but my cousin was charged  over $$500 to ship two tribal  drums carefully wrapped in custom carry bags. In Houston her drums sustained serious damage to tHe carry bags. We checked the luggage and drums in. We boarded flight 1570 headed to Los Angeles. The flight attendants stormed up and down  the aisles bumping and destroying anyone's arms or elbows in their egress. There was little to no time to pull your arms in as you were at their mercy as they served the snacks with great haste. Once in Los Angeles we taxied for what must have been 20 minutes and then sat another 10 at the gate. Exhausted we searched for our luggage. The drums were damaged even worse with the custom carry bags held together with duct tape and zip ties! My luggage didn't arrive as I type 2 hours later. I was given a $10 voucher for Dunkin Donuts. A nice gesture but hardly the dinner I hoped for after a full day of travel. I declined the  vouchers and am still waiting for my bag.|united
1196|Garbage airline, garbage employees, garbage policies. Don't bother signing up to be a member it's worthless.|united
1197|Amazing direct flight from LAX to London aboard their new 787. We were in basic economy and the flight was very pleasant and with excellent customer service. They fed us throughout the whole flight and the captain kept us informed. The seats were very comfortable and spacious for basic economy. Would definitely fly with them again.|united
1198|#unitedairlines why cant airlines be like a real business and figure out .... if you know the flight is delayed, why do you board when you already KNOW we are going to sit on the tarmac. It really doesn't seem that hard a thing to figure out not to do that to passengers if you know the airport you are flying into is not letting anyone in|united
1199|"Terrible Airline
Top 5 worst Airlines in the history of Aviation,
They Genuinely do NOT care for your comfort & needs.

And they do everything they can to charge extra Charges.
They are very close to charging people for using the restrooms onboard.

Service is beyond hideous, staff are just unfriendly. They seem unhappy, and hate their jobs and or company.
Seats are Super tight( Sardine Style ).
Just put more people on the plane, & Charge more money.
They charge for a carry on luggage. ( that no longer exists with other airlines) .

They barely offer water , and for the price we pay for the tickets we expect a little more.

At least to be able to choose our own seats.
No Inflight Entertainment.

It is sad, that we Do NOT have better ( good) airline services when flying Locally within the US.

At least Internationally we can fly with foreign Airlines , because they provide a real value product& service to the price we pay.

I would never Fly with them again, save your money and avoid the pain from the service, the pain from the seats.

And most likely The corporations don't Give a shit about our reviews and or our opinions all together ."|united
1200|"My wife and me, had a 8h30 flight from Paris to Newark.

Unfortunately, we didn't have any inflight entertainment.

I send a complaint after this case and believe me, I'm so unsatisfied of reaction's United Custome Care.

Of course, I was disagree for a compensation of only $100 for 2 adults.

I claimed $100 per person but it was refused by United Customer Care.

Luckily, I had a good book and music on my phone. But I saw others - mostly older, digitally-unsavvy folk - reduced to leafing idly through their in-flight magazine before embarking on a staring contest with the seat in front. For endless 8 hours and 30 minutes.

To top it off, I had to read my book in complete darkness because of course, reading light did not work."|united
1201|"Terrible service.

Flight delayed 3 1/2 hours with the lady at the gate saying ""well at least you can enjoy some free water and pretzels""

Miserably small seats with the netting to hold our personal items broken on two of our seats so when we put a book in it just slid through and hit the floor.

They don't maintain the airplane. Audio jack broken on five hour flight so my daughter couldn't hear anything so I had to let her use mine while I sit there for 5 1/2 hours with no entertainment

Horrible communication after the flight with delays literally keeping us 45 minutes in a huge group in the hot tunnel where the electricity off and failed but we waited for a bus to take us across the airport to go through customs for a flight that was delayed 3 1/2 hours. Check out the pic. They literally have a sitting in the dark!!

if you can avoid it avoid United airlines at all cost!!"|united
1202|Recently, I booked  a flight at United airlines app  going to New York.  The day before my flight, I got sick and went to my MD to get a medical certificate   to refund my ticket. I am so grateful to the representative that assisted me. I just went to the UA website and uploaded my certificate. Within 2 weeks I got my full refund. I really appreciate UA for considering the valid reason for canceling the flight.|united
1203|I have a nice experience on the first flight I took going to Cancun. The plane has free movies. The flight going back to LA has movies but passenger needs to pay : (  also.. the cookies they gave us is too sweet|united
1204|Our flight to Las Vegas has been delayed for nearly an hour now :( Hopefully United Airlines employees  will be UNITED to resolve this  problem...|united
1205|"If I could leave 0 starts I would! This airline will not go out of their way to accommodate their clients. I wanted to bring my carry on with me and was even willing to pay a fee to make it happen, they could not care less and completely ignored my request, staff was rude and disrespectful. If you can avoid traveling though this airline I would advice to do so!
Also, take into account that my luggage was smaller than the size limit and the plane was not even at its full capacity, taking my carry on with me would have in no shape or form affected the capacity at all!"|united
1206|"For all the horror stories I hear of holiday travels my experience was rather stress free.

I arrived to the airport earlier than expected (I had planned on bad traffic on the freeways; which there wasn't). I had checked in the night before and had my boarding pass on my phone so I walked straight to security. I arrived to security and there were only 4 people in front of me. It was quick, easy, and stress free. I had no problem getting to my gate and had plenty of seats to choose from. I sat with my book and waited for my flight.

The flight was early and we boarded 5 minutes before the scheduled boarding time. We ended up landing 30 minutes before the scheduled time even with the rain. Over all very pleased with this holiday traveling experience."|united

1209|I would give then a negative stars if i could. The worst delayed and cancelled flights i have ever seen. This was in great weather conditions too!!! I will NEVER fly with this airline again.. tickets could be free and would not trust i would ever get to my destination..|united
1210|The staff at LAX is a special combination of lazy, dickish, and incompetent. It would be hard to find another combination of people who care this little about their job.|united
1211|Seriously the WORST airline. They deserve -100 stars. I have experienced several flight delays and cancellations causing me to completely miss the event that I cannot miss. They did nothing to help and the agents are not trained in customer service skills.|united
1212|My flight to medford UA 5727 was cancelled due to there being no flight crew. I'm stuck in LAX for 10 hours until the next flight out. I was at a funeral yesterday, I manage a business and was supposed to work today and I've also been up since 3:30am. Not only am I grieving and tired, but I'm loosing pay. A full day of pay. I'm beyond upset and angry thay I've been inconvenienced to this extent. I've never in my life had something like this happen when traveling. Unfortuantly this is not the first flight I've had massively delayed when traveling with your airline but the first to be cancelled due to your error and bad planning. Which is appauling. Your $10 food voucher is not good enough compensation for this occurrence. I hope you will do the right thing and make efforts to correct this error with adequit compensation fot my time and loss of wages.|united
1213|My flight experience today was terrible. First flight of the day and delayed for maintenance. Why didn't they check it when it came in? Then they didn't board us pushing departure back further. Then they had to count and recount people on the plane. Everyone on plane going to miss their connections due to this ineptitude.|united
1214|"Moving from Los Angeles to Guam, my family and I chose to fly United because they flew through Hawaii. We packed up our house and shipped most of our things. We then packed up 10 suitcases that we were going to be living out of for the next month until we left.

I called United from the hotel and kept getting forwarded to their call center, which kept dropping my calls (I think 7 times). I finally got through to their not so informed call center and told them that I wanted to check in my bags a day early. After 45 mins, the lovely lady on the other end said that I was good to go, to bring my 10 pieces of baggage to United and check them in.

My wife, kids, and I packed up 10 suitcases, tracked down a hotel baggage cart and loaded up a rented truck. We then braved the LA and LAX traffic and finally made it to our destination. We paid for parking and for a couple of baggage carts. I pulled 10 bags to the check in kiosk, where I was told that I could not check my bags in this early. I asked for a supervisor and mr. Jim Chin pretty much laughed at my face. Three United ""agents"" told me this was impossible, on the contrary, I've done this before, flying from Guam and Hawaii.... also, anything is possible, just because one doesn't know, doesn't mean the airline doesn't do it. At any rate, they didn't seem to be too concerned to check or verify this nor were they empathetic of my frustrations. I went on my way, back to lug my bags back to a hotel room and return a rented truck for another day.

United, I'll never fly with you again and I will not have any nice things to say to my followers if they ever ask about your airline."|united
1215|"What happened to my friend a month ago is beyond belief. The person by the name of Jerry Alvarez was not just unhelpful but racist disgusting prick that purposely made sure my friend missed the flight and laughed in her face with the exact words "" hurry up, what are you gonna do now"". I NEVER in my life had to deal with someone like him, NEVER! The company that is so called dedicated to make customer service a top priority hired a racist to be a supervisor who refused to help a customer with already purchased ticket. The customer who had a language barrier and was in the situation with no money with her at all. I am in a huge desire to share my story with every single person in to make sure no one ever books with United. I am happy to provide more details about the unfair, unlawful treatment my friend received from Alvarez."|united
1216|I am over 65 and had to fly to help my mother.   I called United who told me that their middle seats would be kept empty, so I booked my flights.   It wasn't true.   When I called they said they had discontinued their policy.   This is at a time when Covid is increasing.   They will do anything to get your money.   Stay away!|united
1217|"Alright well now back to hating United!

Today I booked using Google Flights a roundtrip ticket to Dusseldorf, Germany from LAX. Going there there was 1 stop in Munich, and coming back 2 stops (1 in Munich and 1 in San Francisco). It was $710 on wonderful basic economy (no checked in luggage and no seat assignment) or $820 for normal economy. I paid the $820 (on a long haul flight it is beyond me why you would be cool saving a little $ to be in the middle). On UA's site, it said I have to go on Lufthansa's website to choose the seats as it only let me pick the seat assignments on UA's flights that was Munich to San Francisco (last row by the toilet was all that was left without wanting to pay even more $) , and SF to LA.

Not a big deal. I go to Lufthansa's website to choose my seats and on all their flights, I had to pay more $$$ to choose a seat even though I paid the extra $ on UA to have that be included.

Luckily I caught this within an hour of booking so I got my free cancellation. I thought this was saving me a few hundred bucks since all the other flights to Europe around the time were a bit more, but the flights would have ended up actually being the same or more."|united
1218|"As an adult I've only flown United once booked with miles from LAX to LHR. I signed up for the United credit card which paid for a one way ticket to Europe off season. 2 months or so after I did the promotion I saw that there was a better one and I called. They actually gave me the 20,000 extra miles without there being red tape. I'm not used to that and didn't expect it, so I went from 30,000 mile promo to 50,000. I also found that they were more flexible with using low miles than American was with booking seats. The availability was a million times better.

My seat itself was comfortable but it was because I spent the extra $100 or so to get the economy seat with more leg room. Normally I don't pay fees like that but given it being what I consider a long flight, I paid it and have no regrets.

I completely forgot what the food was like. I seem to remember a little piece of toast lol? I guess that means not terrible but not great.

They also give you 2 passes each year to use the lounge which is great when you need to kill time."|united
1219|"I fly United often.  Sometime work related.  Sometimes Vacation.  This review is for the LAX-HNL route and some comments on the airlines in General.

The good:  1. At both Airports the plane is at the gate.  Sometimes American Airlines will make you shuttle to another area of LAX.  2. Customer Service has always been great for me.  3. Connecting flights.  Even with a 45 minute break between flights I had no issues with baggage making it to the final destination. 4. Multiple flights in a day.  Up to 4.  5. United Miles/One Star Alliance- Multiple Major worldwide airlines involved.  Being able to use your miles on other flights is awesome!  I'm Japan I was able to use mile rewards on ANA flights from Haneda to Okinawa.

Need Improvements:  1. Get a new plane for this heavily popular route.  Very old.  Tray tables fragile and have to play with them to get the out of he armrest.  2. WiFi/Entertainment.  The HNL-LAX flight had no WiFi.  The LAX-HNL flight had WiFi after take off.  They made announcements to download the United App for entertainment options but they didn't have WiFi available.  ""Please ask your Neighbors to use their cell for a hotspot to download the app"".  It's 2017.  Most flights anywhere in the world with 5 hours or longer flights have monitors.

I think a lot of the issues would be solved if they updated their fleet.  2.5 rounded up because they got me committed via their mileage program."|united
1220|This is for the cabin crew from Flight 2069 bound from Newark to LA. I was not onboard but my parents spoken highly of the cabin crew. My 2 year-old son was motion sickness during the flight and they accommodated my son very well. They keep on checking my son if he was fine and after he threw up, the FA assigned in my parents cabin assured them that it is oftentimes normal for a kid to throw up during landing. My son even kept on transferring from seat to seat since my mom and dad sat separately during the flight. My parents had bad experienced with Southwest one time, this moronic flight attendant yelled at my dad, thank goodness I wasn't there because my son got irritable during a flight. Anyways, to the cabin crew of 2069 flight from EWR to LAX 01/06/2020. Thank you very much.. to the flight crew, thank you captain for bringing my family home. God bless everyone.|united
1221|"This airline is a hit and miss. I have had awesome experience with them and I have had horrible experience with them. Most flight experience have been meh. Yes no matter what the experience is I still end up flying with them. The reason for it is that I am Premier Gold status. I like the points.

My home country is Canada and I collect Aeroplan points. United Airlines is part of Star Alliance. So when I fly with them I get access to their lounge. They don't have great snacks or food at their lounge but its free.

United airfare is cheaper or I think its cheaper then other airlines. So that is a pro with United. But with United you have a high chance of being bump. Yes they always overbook. I would say 1 out of 3 flights i have been on they are always offering voucher to people to give up their seat.

I once got a $1000 United Voucher to give up my seat but it wasn't voluntarily. I had no seat and they told me the market price for that flight was $1000 and I was given that. I watch the plane leave and I was still arguing with them.

High chance of making your next trip free or discounted if you fly with United."|united
1222|"Can I put negative stars. This airline has to be the most unprofessional, unorganized, dysfunctional organization. Please go out of business do us all a favor! My wedding was ruined delayed flights missed connections. On my way back from  our trip same thing. Unreal. 29 years ago this  happened to me and my sister. Stranded in dead of winter in Denver. Worst ever. Swore would never fly United. This time thought what the HELL  it's a short trip to Vegas. Worse nightmare. Wedding ruined. Please for the sake of mankind close down UNITED AIRLINES. I've spoken to several people. All feel the same. Wish there was more I can DO to stop people from flying with this airline. If Mr. John VanDeCamp is still CEO of this company explains everything. Couldn't even take care of his mother properly! I would know. My parents were caretakers of Mrs VanDeCamp.
Please everyone do not fly UNITED AIRLINES. Your trip will be ruined. I can guarantee, promise and bet!!"|united
1223|Worst airline ever!!!!! Never will I ever fly these guys again. I purchased extra comfort seats and did not get them. Then I asked for a upgrade and they were not able to offer me any upgrades even though I wanted to pay for it because of the ticket I purchased. Never, never again!!!!!!! Also flight delayed. Terrible customer service. Baggage claim Person terribly rude .|united
1224|"I've had the misfortune of flying United 3 times in the past 30 days. While debarking the first flight I was chastised by an employee for assisting my girlfriend who is in a wheelchair.

Second flight we arrived at the gate 90 minutes early and found no one their. Went back 30 minutes prior to the flight to discuss special needs with the wheelchair boarding. With other airlines this timeframe is acceptable. The gate agent told us we were out of luck and it was our fault for not showing up early. As a result we're not given time to board properly.

Today I flew out of O'Hare. I approached the United counter to resolve an issue with online check in. The person manning the rope line said no, that I'd have to use the kiosk. Despite my protests he would not listen or make eye contact. I went to the kiosk where I encountered the same issue with checking in. End result was that a person from the counter had to come and approve my check in.

Overall the employees I've encountered have been well below the standard of other airlines I've traveled. Avoiding United in the future."|united
1225|The flight was delayed for 3 hours and we didn't take off for another hour which is a total of 4 hours wasted. They waited until we took off to notify us that the next flight was cancelled with no other available flights. I along with many other passengers were stuck in Newark, NJ with no available flight. I had no choice but to reserve a ticket back to Toronto and fly back the next day. They didn't offer any hotels to anyone. My luggage was sent back to me a week later despite them lying and saying it would be back in a day. They lied, cheated, took their sweet time, we're beyond disorganized and offered no compensation. I had to pay a lot of expenses as a result plus the horrible experience I had to go through. I will never forget this. I'll be sure to spit anytime I see or hear about United Airlines. 1 star is too much for this horrible airline.|united
1226|"Last night stuck in Den flight 1946 was delayed 12 times. Terminal changed 11 times back and fourth.

The flight was due to arrive around 8pm at Burbank air port. Even I know the noise Ordinance is in effect from 10pm to 7am. And when it was posted departure 11am. I made  concerns known, with a ""well it says itll still go"".

How does your airline not know about the Ordinance? Bet you knew, and low and behold, you cancelled the flight when it reads a 1am departure time...hmm

We are met with not even a hotel comp let alone a meal voucher...

Asked comly for another flight, even gave airport options not just Burbank and I get nothing. I show them a flight leaving from American Airlines at 6am, I ask for that flight, supposidly booked...

Yet amazingly enough infront of the customer service rep and the rep on the line at the same time I not only book the flight, but get my boarding info and check in options within a minute.

Straight trash service."|united
1227|"Surprise! Had the friendliest counter service at LAX. It was easy to check my bags and zip through security. Maybe airport staff were grateful the holiday rush was drawing to a close because everyone was courteous and smiling.

United has challenges boarding passengers...It was orderly, but very slow. People had trouble locating places to put their bags in the overhead bins so the aisles backed up. If gate agents don't filter for excess carry-ons per person or pull overstuffed bags for stowing as luggage, the lack of space is a complication for attendants on board."|united
1228|I've been trying to get a refund for a flight that United cancelled due to covid. It's been more than 2 months and I have received 3 of the 4 passenger refunds! Very horrible customer service. I just want my money back!|united
1229|We boarded a flight with the gate agent Celina to the United Airlines flight from Chicago to Huntsville she called me a bitch and refused to let us in until the last minute. She's racist and discriminating. However, we had an amazing outstanding excellent flight attendant Sofia. She should train your staff!!! She was welcoming, attentive, generous with her time!!! Excellent flight with such first class service on a coach budget!!! What's admirable about was that Sofia worked our entire flight which was full totally alone!!!

I had to pay $30 for my luggage but I had a super inexpensive flight so I didn't mind that. I used to fly standby with them and always had a great experience, everyone is vvery helpful and friendly.|united

1237|Well this was my first flight after achieving 1 million miles flown on United. This makes me a permanent for the rest of my life gold level frequent flyer. It was a one stop Transit from LAX to Maui Via San Francisco. It was nice that we had an upgrade to First Class but it was only a short flight between LA and San Francisco. It was unfortunate that the flight was delayed for mechanical reasons and as the first class Purser checked with us I mentioned that I'm going to miss my connection. So on the spot she said she might be able to rearrange our flights right now so that we can get to Maui. She was checking on her tablet and saw that we had first class seats available direct from LA to Maui but they were blocked from her tablet to assign. So she got the gate agent to pull us off get our bags and switch our seats. To gate agents got involved and had to call the other gate agent to unlock those seats in first class. As it turned out we got them and would be arriving in Maui only 15 minutes later than if we had taken our connection on time through San Francisco. While we are waiting I picked up a couple of nice almond croissants and drop them off for the gate agents as a token of appreciation for their scramble. At that point I mentioned this was to be my first flight as a million mile gold Patron. They replied with thanks and that I did not have to get them anything but just the same I was grateful. Otherwise the flight was cozy. My checked bags for the last to come off the conveyor belt in Maui and just a minute before they appeared the the baggage representative for United had approached us asking if our bags had arrived or not. Obviously her timing was just right and it turns out I had no problem. Strength of just the outbound flight I'm happy to post five stars again for United.|united
1238|"I hate to do this because I've flown a great deal with United - lifetime miles are near 800,000 now - but I had a disappointing flight from Houston to Fort Lauderdale.  Never before have I seen such indifference towards the passengers from the cabin staff?  No smiles - skipping ME for offering a beverage?  I've done NOTHING to earn such indifference - plus I noted pretty much everyone being treated the same way?

Strange.

At any rate - since 911 this decade plus has seen a serious steady slide in quality of service.  If not for the mileage plus program and the 400ish thousand I have in frequent flier mileage I would have completely left United.  I still try to fly them to continue accruing miles and attain flight benefits - but the reasons for doing so are being blotted out by the ... rotten service.  SIgh..."|united
1239|"Just got off the plane at LAX. We had a flight from Chicago to LAX.  Sat in economy. Wasn't bad but seats seemed smaller than the last plane we were in with United.  It was comfortable nevertheless. The plane was clean!! The flight attendants were very nice and caring. There was one in particular who was real caring and her hospitality and smile showed that she must really like her job. Patricia was her name. She definitely inspired me to fly with United from now on.
The pilots did a fantastic job flying the 737!

Agent 3 of 3, wraps ups with a customer, calls me up, tells me she can't help with a boarding pass.

We booked 4 seats first class and was all smooth and peaceful throughout the whole flight. Positive flight attendants, services, foods and drinks were decent like any other airlines. The only issue we face was a 6 hours delayed due to high winds in our connecting flight from Newark Liberty International Airport.  While on the wait kids got frustrated and didn't want to get back on the plane afterwards other than that flight was smooth throughout the whole trip.|united
1245|"Saved miles for twenty years to fly to Italy in business class.  Probably my last chance at my age.  Trip to Rome was lovely in a modern plane.  Trip home was booked by United on Turkish Air.  Crew was as kind as could be, but a 737 from Rome to Istanbul (?!?!) then 14 hours on a 777 from Istanbul to LA.  I spent 450,000 miles to fly home for fourteen hours on a 20 year old plane.  Very, very disappointed.

Again, Turkish Airlines flight crew was great, but I feel ripped off by United having spent so much - virtually all my years of accumulated miles - to fly home on ancient planes."|united
1246|"United airline sucks. Will never fly again. Ever. The worst service. The worst crew ever
Every body is crap, from pilots to the crew."|united
1247|"I believe in recognizing outstanding service, so I want to say THANK YOU to United Customer Service desk agent Andres Ruiz at LAX for making my day! Andres helped me find an earlier flight to avoid a 7 hour layover (which would have made this an exhausting, 24 hour day of traveling.) Andres was patient, kind, gracious and extremely professional. Even if he hadn't been able to improve my itinerary I would rate his service as stellar.
This is why I always choose United!
If you're traveling and happen to have the pleasure of working with Andres at the customer service desk, give him a pat on the back.
Thank you, again so much for such a great experience!!"|united
1248|"This is a tricky one, but I'm going to try my best. Travelling can be tedious and tiring, but with friendly staff, it can be enjoyable (especially with friendly flight attendants). I have flown United plenty of times in the past, I've never had an outstanding personal issue with them. My only gripe is simply that air travel is over priced and over booked. But this is not specific to United Airlines, this is regarding all travel airlines. To me, it seems like either one of two things, either they are tactfully filling up every seat on the plane possible in order to make each flight worth while financially...or...they are making it harder and or uncomfortable for you so you can be tempted to upgrade to first class. Maybe it's both, lol, but regardless, it's about money, business is business, nothing personal as stated earlier. And again, I've had no issues with United airlines. The only thing I can suggest is if they could simply hire workers that are more outgoing and or could at least smile more. They are so blah and boring when you interact with them. Not all of course, but some are just so robotic it's like they have no personality, and it's almost awkward at times. But I guess nothing in life is perfect, we can't have everything our way.

I did forget to insert my mileage plus member number when booking my flights, but thankfully their system automatically added the miles to my account a few days after my travel was over. Thank you for this.

I will say this, I am happy and pleased that safety is of utmost importance to all travelling airlines. For that alone, they all deserve a 5 star review. I am grateful, and thankful for making it safely to and back from all my trips...God bless us all."|united
1249|"Will not give United our business again!! I called them to say we needed to cancel our March 21 flight because our cruise was cancelled, they said they were giving people ""flying credits"" but I needed to do everything through travel One, because we'd booked through them, well travel one was completely unreachable. At that point I just went to my credit card since no one was helping us.I explained what happened,credit  card gave us a credit, then a few weeks later United reversed the credit....a very unwelcome surprise.Billing us because we didn't get on an airplane during a high risk travel advisory!! i hope they go bankrupt!!"|united
1250|"8/25 my brother and I purchased 2 of the same ceramic statues in San Miguel de Allende. We picked them up on 8/26 walked half way through town to prepare it for our afternoon flight on United flight #5485 leaving leon airport to LAX . On arrival to the airport we proceeded to check in at the counter. The gentleman at check in took my bag ( checked it in )and saw me with my ceramic piece of art that was in a different bag and he didn't say a word to my brother and I about not being able to take it on the flight .Matter a fact my brother got on the flight ahead of me and the stewardess was most helpful , and put his fragile package in the front of the plane. It was not that way for me! My package went past security but your employee stopped me ,and wouldn't let me through to board with my package , and I told him the guy on the ground, that you just let my brother through with the same piece of art.but he didn't care, it also didn't help that I was a tourist in another country not speaking Spanish, . So he took my piece of art and wouldn't give me a receipt, all he said I Think ,was just that I can pick it up tomorrow! He knows I'm going back to the United States. Your employee did come on the flight to take a photo of me and my seat, after I had taken one of him and his badge, So that I could write this letter. So he could have seen my brothers statue,because it was in the front of the plane. So why can one person take a package on a flight and Another can not?Its the exact same item on the same flight but I was refused to bring it on board . was it because of the way I dressed, was it a policy change between the 5 minuets my brother walk through and I walked through. It's also Odd that no one spoke English! I am enclosing a photo of my brothers wrapped art piece which is sitting inside the plane ,and a photo of the id of your employee.

On a high note your employee Debbie on our flight was a ambassador she tried everything in her power to make me feel welcome, if I was starting a company I would recruit her! Yes she is that good!

I'll give credit where credit is do. but you guys made me feel like I was going to go to prison for a souvenir , the door was about ready to close and my 8 friends and my wife were off. I'm on my flight writing this without my souvenir and I'll feeling like your employees can do anything they want!"|united
1251|Our first flight was ok, however coming back they put us on a small plane that was so small that I head to keep my head down or else I would hit it while walking. I was so uncomfortable on this plane it didn't make any sense. This was a plane that sat one passenger on the left and two on the right. So uncomfortable.|united
1252|Waited 8 hours before leaving LAX.  On and off the plane 3 times.  I was sick and got a voucher for $10 but the food booths were closed.  Got chips and a small sandwich at one last place.  United offered me miles and a $100 credit which expired in a year.  The flight was to London.  EU rules are a much larger pay out for 4 hour delays. i see why United has such low ratings for an airline.  I wanted $100 cash but still haven't heard back.  Don't want to fly with United.  Very disappointed|united

1255|Worst airline ever. Ruined our family vacation.  Had us all board the plane.  Then they had us come off the plane.  4 hour delay.  Changed gates.  Long walk.  Kids were crying and upset.  Got into Hawaii at 10pm.  instead of by our dinner plans.  In the past they've lost my luggage.  They also pulled an asian man out of his seat and smashed his face on an armrest.   Change your name to DIVIDED!|united
1256|This is my first NEGATIVE REVIEW because I need to vent.   THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT UNITED THAT MAKES ME FEEL UNITED with their company and customer service.  I want to throw a vase right now.  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE.   If I have the choice, I will never fly United again.   I'm done with them.|united
1257|"Sent this to United on Facebook. So far they said they were escalating the issue to the LAX leadership team. Will update if I hear back from them.

Aloha,

I had a horrible experience on Friday, August 7 flying from LAX to Hilo, Hawaii (flight 1004). I'd like some follow up and an apology because I'm already fed up with my many negative experiences on United.

As I was settling into my seat behind the exit row, an African American man took a seat in the exit row. No one else was there. A flight attendant asked him to return to his seat because he needed to pay $100 to be upgraded to the exit row. That's fine; I understand that. As they talked, however, I noticed that she began yelling at him and speaking sarcastically, which made me uncomfortable. I asked if United asks for volunteers to sit in the exit row. Simple question. In previous flights I remember flight attendants doing so. She then started berating me and telling me to look things up at united.com and that we only need people in the exit rows if the plane crashes. She said that the plane wasn't going to crash and asked if I wanted the plane to crash. That made me REALLY uncomfortable. I asked her for her name, but she refused to give it to me. She told me to call United and ask for her name because she's the only Asian flight attendant on the flight. I'm also Asian. She continued to yell at me. It got to the point where I needed to repeat several times that I was done. I felt belittled and unsafe.

About five minutes later, another flight attendant passed by. I told her I was sorry and that I wasn't sure what happened with the first flight attendant. I also told her that I felt uncomfortable because of the way the first flight attendant was speaking to me. That first flight attendant came over and interrupted our conversation and began to berate me again. She accused me of trying to sit in the exit row (I never did, and I never asked to), and she accused me of calling her unprofessional (I never did, though I was thinking it). I even said that they could ask anyone around us if what she said was true because I knew I was being wrongly accused. The other flight attendant suggested we just start over and have a good flight. I said fine, but the first flight attendant demanded that I say that she's not unprofessional. I didn't. Eventually she left, and I heard her gossiping about me as they walked away. The African American man came back to me and said that she continued to talk about me, but he didn't think I did anything wrong. I almost got off of the flight, but I needed to get to a work meeting that night.

Later in the flight I just wanted things to be okay relationally. I had brought a box of macadamia nut chocolates to give to the flight attendants (something I often do on long flights, but didn't have the opportunity to earlier because of the situation). However, when I offered them to her, she refused them. That's fine.

I am upset with how she treated me, and she refused to give me her name. I do not want her to treat other customers the way she treated me. This issue isn't about the exit row. This issue is about how a flight attendant treats customers. I've flown this LAX-Hilo flight several times since it's the only flight between Hilo and California. She mentioned that she works this flight three times a week, so I now feel uncomfortable flying this flight and would even do a layover in Honolulu or Maui instead of being on a flight with her.

Please follow up with me for any questions and to let me know what is being done.

Thank you"|united
1258|"How bad can United get?

I was humiliated at LAX today. When I checked in at Madison yesterday the agent was unable to check my bag all the way to my final destination in Hilo because of a long layover in Los Angeles. He told me to pickup my bag in LA and check it back in, and he assured me that I wouldn't have to pay again. When I picked up my bag in LA I tried checking it back in at baggage claim, and the man told me I couldn't at the time and also assured me that when I did check in that I wouldn't need to pay for the bag again.

Just now at LAX I went to the additional services desk where I was told I needed to pay for the bag. I explained the situation, and woman told me there was nothing she could do. When I spoke to a manager ""D R"" she said that the previous United agents lied to me and that I had to pay again. I feel so humiliated right now and am horrified by the service I received. There is no good reason for me to lie.

I'd like to be reimbursed for needing to pay twice and receive an apology for the horrible service I received. I've been flying United for over 20 years, and I will change the airlines I use if not. Thank you."|united
1259|"I've flown United many times, and I've let go some of my previous negative experiences, but some experiences of racial discrimination on my last flight make me want to say something now.

On Saturday I flew from LA to Honolulu on United. If I had only one negative experience, I might not be writing this review, but three different experiences of racial discrimination make me really uncomfortable.

1) I was sitting next to a Chinese couple (I'm Asian), and one of the workers (an elderly man) asked the woman next to me if she's Japanese. She said no. Not sure why he would ask this point blank without having much of a conversation or basis for asking. If they were talking for a while it might be okay to ask what her heritage is, but instead he assumed and was wrong.

2) During one of the drink service times, one of the workers (a woman) skipped over our whole row (we're all Asian). She served everyone around us. An Australian woman sitting across the aisle from me noticed and seemed uncomfortable about it too.

3) When the flight attendants were passing out the agriculture declaration forms, the woman assumed that I was with the two others in my row. I had to explain that we weren't. She assumed without asking that because we were all Asian that we were together.

I'd appreciate a response from United and will update my review if appropriate."|united
1260|In these scary times n changes world wide how our lives will change.  With Covid19.  How about ALL airline companies change back to how we use to fly.  Remove rows n seats to make it safer to fly.  Give us larger seats n space to recline n leg room plus not cramped in soo close to the next person.  We r your paychecks.

1261|"Today, we were stranded in LAX after a lengthy Chicago flight delay.

It would not have been so bad had it not been we were traveling with our kid, it's her 6th birthday tomorrow, and we both had to get back to work and then to various stores to get her party ready.  Thankfully, we were able to meet Paul Cha in LAX.

After wringing our hands waiting for our turn in United's customer service line, when we approached his desk, he was able to get us on a flight back to Honolulu so we could make it back home late this evening.

He was swift, kind, and understanding of our predicament. He was able to QUICKLY process not just our travel changes but all of the other stranded travelers that were forced to change flights after a mechanical error had resulted in missing their LAX connecting flights.

We really appreciated Paul's support and kindness. Tomorrow, my daughter is going to have a wonderful birthday ... at home (and not waking up early to catch an 8a LAX flight) complete with ice cream cake, more lollipops, and presents from grandma and grandpa, which will be very nice after 22+ hours of traveling.  Our dog was grateful that we were back early, as well.

I'm not always pleased with our experiences with United; however, I do appreciate how astute they are in recognizing that they need people like Paul. Thank you!"|united
1262|"I had to check in with an attendant and they informed e i could not bring my carryon on the plane. It was the only bag i had with all of medicine,cloths, and everything else i needed for my work trip. I pulled up the basic economy tules where it states i can bring a personal item. They refused to let me keep and threatened to not let me bored. I asked if i could pay for it to go on the plane with me where i was rudely told no. The attendant was extremely rude and would not listen. Well turns out when we landed United lost my luggage. They have no idea where it is. I have no cloths or shoes or meds that i need. They wont refund me the extra money i had to pay to check the luggage and they told me they will only give me $150 dollars toward all the stuff in my bag. 1 shirt in that bag that i just bought today before my flight was $80. The hair care products and skin care products are worth over $60. My meds alone are even more. All they are will to give me is $150 and i need to spend my own money and wait for them to reimburse me.

This airline is a joke. You treat people like crap. I am here for a job interview. No stores even open till 10 and i have to be at my interview at 10. You guys really screwed me."|united
1263|"Have to write that I am extremely displeased with the service I received from UA.  I was on my way to LAX sitting in intense traffic and realizing that I would not make it in time for boarding my flight to RDM.  I called customer service to see if there was a later flight I could get on and was told that I could but that it would cost me $200 to do that and that I ""should have called earlier.""  Well, that would have been lovely had I known there would be such traffic delays.  Regardless, I was not offered any of assistance.  I tried to make it to the airport and did not make it in time.  Fortunately, I was able to get a one-way ticket via Delta that was departing in the next 30 minutes.  

The following day, I could not check in for my flight on 7/28 (on Delta) to get home.  UA had ""closed my ticket.""  I called another UA representative who was equally uncaring and told me similarly that ""I should have called.""  When I mentioned I had done so on 7/26, there was no releasing of my flight to get home on 7/28 UNLESS i paid another $200 to ""release"" the ticket.  I was kindly offered a $182 eVoucher that I unfortunately could not use for this $200 that I would be charged to release my ticket to get home.  So, I was stranded in Redmond, OR because United decided to treat a customer like a criminal for ""not calling earlier.""  I had also purchased a better seat on the flight from Lax to Rdm.  Of course that $60.00 was also now lost.  

I declined to ""release the ticket"" and thus have to spend an additional $200 just to get home.  Fortunately, I booked a one way on Delta with miles.  It's amazing that UA is still flying people around with the type of customer ""service"" that was provided to me.  Felt like I was dealing with the mafia.  I dont expect to ever do business with UA in the future, nor will i recommend UA to anyone.  Ever."|united
1264|"I just wanted to let everyone know, this airline has lost customers, not only myself but all my family and friends.
I have a round trip via AA and the return is via UA. All of a sudden when printing out my boarding passes, I am informed I must check my normal carry on AND pay $25. This is a terrible imposition/money making scheme. I must pack audio and computer parts in my carry on which are very expensive and they will most likely be damaged.
Some people have enough money to not care but I dont. So dont fly United Airlines
ABSOLUTELY NO STARS"|united
1265|"I have been flying for the past 40 years and I have never ever had to encounter such a bad experience than this one. I exchanged my miles with Citibaank and I try to check in and I was told by computer and by agents that I cannot it do it since it is the basic economy. Not only I had to pay double the miles but also I had to pay an additional $300 for the tickets. So in total I ended up spending far more on these tickets that I had to spend or a regular purchase. They are not cheap.. and I should not be treated that way... Shame on United Airlines for being so greedy and cheap for a crappy travel..

I hope I am not placed in the tail of the flight out in the air with not seat belt.... Shame on you United Airlines"|united
1266|"DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
This is a long post so I want to write this first. I am not looking for money ( I know this pathetic company well and they are moving cattle and do not care about their everyday customers, only about their Polaris flyers) so I don't expect a dime from this but hell if I am not going to tell this story EVERY SINGLE CHANCE I GET, TO EVERY ONE THAT LISTENS AND OIN EVERY SINGLE SITE I CAN FIND.

If United cared about their customers, they would have better, more compassionate employees that would do their best to help stuck, lied to, neglected customers feel better and would streamline their processes to make sure that after they lied to their customers, at least, they would resolve things in a quick and professional manner.

We supposedly had bad weather and we were reverted to Indianapolis where they all of the sudden needed to refuel real quick and then after an hour, there's a mechanic on the plane that got on the loudspeaker and said they had ""fixed the issue"" but according to the captain there was bad weather in Newark. Then, they proceed to count the empty seats over 10 times to sell the seats of the folks that were able to leave the plane in Indianapolis. So they filled the plane back up to make sure they got as much money as possible, three hours later, the mysterious weather was fixed and then, once the plane was sold out again we left for Newark where we missed our connection (mysteriously, the weather was good for that flight to leave but not for us to land)

Then of course, we stood in line for 3 hours in the supposed customer service line to have their shitty staff belittle us and condescend us and book us a flight the next day.
But wait, there's more, go down to baggage claim to get your luggage. ""Oh no, you have to request your luggage and it will take 4 to 6 hours to receive your luggage.

Meanwhile, go take a train to another terminal and find the hotel kiosk and tell them to give you a distressed rate.
Guess what, every hotel that wasn't sold out said, ""no distressed rate, United was supposed to give you a voucher"" meanwhile, it's 1:30am and we find the closest motel 25 miles away where we are charged $96 one way by the taxi company to be able to get a few hours sleep before we have to check out and go back to the airport (another $90) and of course, we weren't able to go to the United lounge because we're not first class.
This company has no idea what customer service means. Their supposed customer service agents were so rude and so nasty that it makes you angry that you spent thousands of dollars to be treated like shit. At one point, when I approached a lady she throws her hand up & says STOP! come back later when there's another agent here..."|united

Nothing found
Then I went back to where they prepare the snacks and a person standing asked me if I lost something ! I said a wrist watch and he responded .... a watch like so and so! I said yes ! And he replied , a lady founded in the departures lobby floor and gave it to the United attendant at the counter of that same departure terminal ! Easy to find you would think.  but as it was a 1500 Raymond Weil, I reported it immediately when landed at LAX , but to this date  0ct 10, 2019 was not found ! So be careful, people who work for United Airlines are not to trust ! Seems some one who received it for lost and found, kept it ! The plane had the doors open and should of asked passengers already in, if some has lost it , mmmmmm but not. I will take Off this report from Yelp . If They find it ! Thanks"|united

I have been a member of United for a long time and United was my favorite airline but after today I don't feel the same. I fly Basic Economy sometimes and I have always got on the plane just fine with a small roller bag and a purse. My Roller bag always fits under the seat. On this particular day I was asked to pay $30 for my bag. I am appalled, I have never had to pay for this bag and on top of that the employee under the leadership of Ms. Rameriz was rude.

Ive been a United mileage member for over 20 years, spending 1000s and giving then Tons of interest. But because I didn't have my mileage plus card with me they forced me to pay $30 to check a small roller bag that fits in a small overhead, even though the ticket says that United mileage plus members don't have that policy!. On top of that  everybody at the two terminals were very rude and one person at customer service was so rude she told me if I wanted to file a complaint I could walk about a 1/2 mile to a different customer service area even though my flight boards in 25 minutes.its pretty simple now to understand why most of their reviews are negative.
In the past 12 months I've been on 8 different airlines and  this is by far the very worst one I've ever seen. I hope I don't get charged to use the restroom. I will balance transfer my balance then close my credit card and never fly this airline again. Even if the flight is less than SE/American, Alaskan  Air Canada  jet blue and Delta or any of the others that are higher at least they are better.
I really did not want to be forced to check a 20 inch light roller bag when the flight isnt even full. I had a bad experience on United 2 years ago but heard they'd gotten better
Nope. When they advertise fly the friendly skies that slogan died long ago when they actually cared about good customers
At nearing 60 years old this is their loss.  I have a lot of travel left in me for an airline that appreciates their customers and doesnt charge for what is included with all the rest. Seriously sad. Maybe they eventually will fold"|united

1277|"This airline failed to meet even the least of our expectations on both occasions flying with them. They closed the door right in front of our faces after we explained we had an infant and had to gather his things in order to run up to the gate. There were four gates situated in one area and between the loud speaker, large crowds, and numerous lines randomly dispersed, it was difficult to distinguish or hear where we should have been.
Upon flight substitution, the customer service agent was quick and kind to accommodate our family of eight to make it into three different flights spread throughout that 24 hour period. (She being the only reason they receive a one star rating.)

Sadly, upon departing our destination to return home, the aforementioned agent failed to reassign three of our party(including the baby) on our return flight. The three were stuck at the airport for an additional seven hours until they could be placed on a flight. This meant our party had to wait on the opposite end at home to take them home with us as well.
As we all flew home, the planes were outdated with no entertainment or food options. The flight attendants were rude and aloof despite our attempts to show kindness and respectful retorts to questioning. In a time of when many passengers experience anxiety and uncertainty, the flight attendants main objective is to show common courtesy. This flight was not that way. There will never be a time I will put myself or my family under the care of United again."|united

1280|"This is my first consumer review for an airline. I've flown United once or twice a year for eight years and before their merger, flew Continental.

On April 7, my flight from Houston to Orange County was delayed several times by half hour or hour increments due to thunderstorms in East Texas. I received five text messages updating me of these delays until an alert was sent indicating that my flight had been delayed nine hours until the next morning. No problem, I'd rather not fly through dangerous weather. I exited the airport and returned home, where I discovered via yet another text message that my flight had been rescheduled for that night. Of course by this time, I'd left the airport and missed that flight.

I phoned Customer Care and rather than being told the missed flight was my responsibility, Vivian put me on a flight home the following afternoon. She answered my questions thoroughly. My baggage beat me to Orange County by ten hours but when I entered baggage claim, I heard my name paged and United had my bag waiting for me. Granted, if I'd flown into Houston Intercontinental or Chicago O'Hare I would've expected much greater difficulty retrieving my bag than I did in a boutique airport like John Wayne, but the airline did have it there waiting for me.

If United had refused to put me on a flight the following day or lost my luggage I most certainly would be on Yelp logging a nasty review, so must cite the airline for resolving my concerns in a professional, satisfying way. I will definitely continue flying this airline."|united
1281|"If I have a choice of a negative evaluation, I'd like to choose it rather than giving United Airline 1 star.

On the way from LAX to SFO, United Airline forced us to wait close to 1 hour on LAX runway on 8/24/19, because of airport congestion issue at SFO. Then, a 50's lady became sick and crews needed to call Ambulance. This caused us to go back to the gate. However, she was coherent and was able to walk away on her own feet when the ambulance came. It ended in arriving at SFO 2.5 hours later.
Then, I found out that I missed the flight from SFO to KIX(Osaka, Japan) although one of the flight attendants initially told me that the next flight has 17 passengers from this flight and therefore, it would wait for us. She lied to me. At the customer service in SFO, a customer service representative couldn't find the flight to KIX on 8/24 despite the fact that my dad was ill (he has two cancer) and I needed to go back asap. She gave me the next day flight and $30 meal vouchers. However, when asking her any refund, such as hotel reservation on 8/25(initially I was scheduled to be in Osaka on 8/25), she said that I have a way to request a refund. This was also not true. At the end, I was able to cancel the hotel reservation without penalty, but I'm in the middle of requesting United AIrline to refund me a fee for my wi fi router rental on 8/25 in Osaka. But it's not easy. Even if I explained about rental wi fi, they confuse it as a flight wi fi. In short, I'm very unsatisfied with the services of United Airlines. I will no longer use United Airline."|united
1282|I really  hope this airlines  goes bankrupt and all employees  lose everything  again ignorant  flight attendants  ignorant  captains they don't  deserve  1 star  I fly only first class  they don't treat you that way|united
1283|"What can I say without being to dramatic.... Let's just say, I will not fly or recommend this carrier to anyone. My experience during this past trip we took was extremely stressful. I won't go into details, I understand it can be more affordable, but your better off spending a little more to avoid chaos. Aside from that, made it to our destination and back home safely. #nomoreunitedairlines #getittogether #jetlag #teamnosleep #theirwifiisntfree!! #canceledflight #delayedflights

1284|"Since this is the first time I've flown United I would give them the benefit of the doubt. 5 Stars to the amazing flight crew & 2.5 for the awful tightly squeezed economy seats... Read on.

If you are facing a 21 hr flight, you would need to be in the most comfortable seat possible, however, not everyone is born with a silver spoon in their mouth and could afford flying 1st all the time, with that said, United's seats aren't the worst but absolutely won't make it to the ranks of the best either not even good - it's just okay and that's the long and short end of it, I guess what's really annoying about their seats is due to the fact that they really squeezed the economy seats together, it is cramped almost like your elementary school bus. Seriously now, if you are at least 6'2 or higher, good luck getting comfortable especially when the guy in front of you reclines their seat. Thumbs down on seat arrangement. (You say upgrade for leg room? Prepare to shell out a hefty $$$ - uhmkay?)

Almost everything will cost you if you want to use inflight services these days ( not just with United really);

Wifi: I find their wifi service pretty good and fast enough to handle business while onboard the plane, respond to emails and do the occasional fb browsing (ok more fb browsing than working haha) for $13, it's worth paying for it especially during extended flights.

Tablet rentals: if you have more than one child - please avail this $10.00 service to entertain your kid or bring your iPads or android tabs and download the United app - not only it'll give you a peace of mind but other passengers as well - kids will be kids but nobody likes a screaming kid in tantrum, especially during extended flights.

Food: Lordie where do I begin? This one is a fail for me, Southern Wester Bistro Scramble? $8.99 (Sounds fancy - NOT) More like a South Western goo! Not sure what kind of egg they used but seriously did not find this meal to be appetizing at all. It was drenched in gooey melted cheese with some potato bits and something else, the egg was unrecognizable, I suggest buying a pre packed lunch before you go because inflight microwaved food is ""No Bueno"".

Charging docks: Good luck! You just have to wait and charge at your destination.

With that said, what makes this flight bearable are the amazing flight crew, the flight attendants are wonderful and truly tried their best to make things as comfortable for you the best they can.

Ok, I better stop writing now as my battery is getting low (again, charging docks or usb charging ports - that would be a nice consolation for the discomfort)"|united
1285|"Seems us Yelpers have a difference of opinion when it comes to United (LAX). Kind of a love hate relationship... For me there are many pluses, a few minuses and what ultimately ends up being a 3 to 4 star rating. (Today, they get four cuz I'm in a good mood but I could easily see justification for three stars as well).

Flying for me, is a necessary evil and I don't always get to pick who I can fly with, corporate travel does. The vast majority of my United trips from here are to two locales... New Orleans and San Antonio. Today, (this morning), it's hot, I'm fungry so I'm starting out with the negatives.

First and foremost, the check in process at Terminals 6/7 is horrendous. There rarely seems to be enough employees to adequately and efficiently move travelers quickly through the terminal. Then there is electronic check in... Where are the customer service peeps? I long for the old days when you dealt with a face, not a monitor.  Which takes me to baggage fees... Ugh!!! I know it's commonplace nowadays but it just slows down the overall process. Add the FUC'n $25 ""baggage fee"" to my airfare and move the lines along already... These are my minus one star... But the reality of it is, you will see this with almost all air carriers unless flying first class, which is a rarity for me...

On to the positives... I try to schedule my flights in the mid to late morning timeframe so I can get there early and hopefully avoid the hair pulling insanity of early morning travel thru LAX. Works almost all of the time... I've only had to be ""rushed"" thru the terminal / security once. There are some nice eating / drinking establishments in the terminals, which are clean and generally well equipped. I have never, EVER, been bumped from a United flight and I've flown them in excess of 50 times. Planes while maybe not always new, are always clean. Flight crews have always been professional and courteous to me. But I think the biggest part of that is Golden Rule-ish. Smile, be friendly, polite and courteous and you will generally reap what you sow. And now, there is free wi-if onboard too.

While another air carrier (I'm not mentioning their name but it starts with south and ends with west), can claim low fares no baggage fees and on-time performance, they can't assign / guarantee seats for me and my wife to be able to sit together, but they can let me ""pre-check"" (for a fee of course), so that I, (we), can possibly board with the ""A"" group and sit together. Doesn't always work that way tho. And I have got bumped off SW flights before. Just sayin'..."|united
1286|I am so shocked that United Airlines is the only US airline that refuses to refund or change a flight to Rome after the CDC and State Department gave it a Level 3 warning AVOID TRAVEL.  This company is profiting off the fact that people are trying to be good US citizens and abide by federal guidelines.  Add to list the list that you will refund to Hong Kong which only has a Level 1 advisory.  That makes NO SENSE and is a discriminatory racist policy.|united
1287|"Flight 1654 LAX to Cancun
Book in January for flight in May, this flight leaves LAX at 11:30 PM so we choose isle seats to use the restroom so we don't bother other customers.  When we arrive at LAX United change our seats to center and window. I ask the gate agent if we can have our original seats back he said no, plane is over booked it is what it is. I said it's not my problem United over booked and he replied this is what you have to expect when you use public transportation you get what they give you.  So when booking you cannot trust what they tell you so be careful if need a seat preference."|united
1288|Airlines deserves zero stars. Awful and non accommodating customer service business. Long wait times on customer service call center. On the phone with customer service for almost 2 hours and they were still unable to help me. I needed to change my flight and I called a few weeks in advance to book a later flight time in the same day. 1 hr difference. The supervior would not approve it! He said I would have to call 30 minutes before my flight. How inconvenient. I would of preferred to take care of it now. Very unresonable. Horrible airlines. Don't ever fly United! I know I never will.|united
1289|I tried to propone my flight before my March 1st departure with United Airlines due to being high risk for the corona virus with no success. I was told I have no choice but to fly. 3 days later their policy changed. March 17 I wanted to change my return flight due to the potential air space closure but not allowed to make a change. Air space closed due to the corona virus, unable to take my original flight March 26th and now I am being gouged for a May 5th flight out. What poor communication, management and policies. Now I am extremely disappointed. The web site says not to call until 72 hours before your flight.|united
1290|"No chance to leave zero stars or negative stars. Bummer. Also have spent so
much time (1.75 hours on hold at 1 point) then too many face to face conversations to even mention and lastly a flight delay mechanical (only to hear that there was a plane at DIA the whole time) that made us miss our connecting flight to Australia for our son's wedding. Long flight 24 hours later (only option) means we miss the reception and rehearsal dinner, waste a night of an expensive AirBnB, stuck in Los Angeles for a day (rent a car) and lose our good seats that we upgraded to on Qantas because they are not available next day. Qantas does not return our
money since it was United's issue. Will never fly United again even if I can save money. $150 from United doesn't even come close to the inconvenience United has caused us.  #sothwestforever, #UAL"|united
1291|"this review is for the corporate. with basic economy tickets, you won't be able to check in online; you have to check in physically at the airport. this is unheard of! with other airlines, despite how cheap the tickets are you can still get boarding passes electronically; this is the first time i'm experiencing this stupid policy. never ever again; will never fly with this company. no wonder my co-workers said they never fly united. i understand why.

United,
Your policy sucks! Not sure how much you save by not allowing people to access boarding passes via online and make them check in physically at the airport on the day of; however, your greedy policy just lost another customer and many more to come. You should be ashamed of adopting this absurd system."|united
1292|I need to cancel my flight SFO to NYC Because of the Coronavirus.   I bought it with miles.  United has asked me to pay a Fee of $125.00 to redeposit my miles back into my frequent flyer account.  This is a rip off!|united
1293|"Missed my flight 830am due to Uber drive blew his tire to avoid an accident and I got sick .  I was booked on a stand  by for a 10:46am flight.  I could not get on 10:46 flight because there were other people rerouted from a cancelled flight. So I was put on stand by for a 2:30pm flight .  That flight was booked also due too canceled flights.   Now I am booked/confirmed for a 4:46pm flight.    I will not arrive to my destination until 11pm tonight.  I cant believe it.

I am not sure how I should feel.   This particular issue is not good . I was not able to cancel reservations and get a refund or credit.   I should have been told during the time I missed the 8:30 flight what was gong to happened.  As of now I have been at the airport  8 hours.  My family is ok stand by as well,,waiting for me to arrive.  I have change my rental car reservations pick up time twice .  I was also told by the gate representative that the customers who have spent more money than me for their flights like First Class, United Airline MileagePlus members or United Express members has first priority over me for all stand bys.  I am grateful for united allowing me to be placed on a stand by,, but also tired and disappointed for their action and the counter representatives at the gates reaction and comments."|united

Never book on United"|united
1295|United Airlines was great in helping us with tickets we purchased for March and cannot use because of the corona virus.   We can't say enough on how helpful they were.|united
1296|I want to add that on my return flight, I upgraded seats to ensure that I could work but then a homeless man was sat next to me (legit), the app and internet was not working, and to top it off there was water leaking from the walls/door into by laptop bag.  Ugh!!!! Are you serious!? How are you still in business?!|united
1297|"First off,  the seat in front of me is broken so it's leaning back super close to my face but yet you still have the audacity to sell it.  I even asked if I could switch and would pay for an upgraded seat but the flight is full.  

Now we're currently sitting on a plane that was scheduled to take off over an hour ago and it's progressively getting hotter on this full flight.   No one, including the pilot has provided any updates whatsoever.   I've always hated United Airlines but this is definitely last time I'll ever fly with them.  It's not worth the couple dollars you save.  It's literally barely a step up from Spirit, outdated planes and sub par service.  I miss you so much Delta!

If you're going to hold us in a hot box for an hour before a 6 hour flight, have the decency to provide timely updates for the inconvenience you have caused."|united
1298|"Booked thru United my dream trip to New Zealand!!! If I had known what was going to happen I would have NEVER booked thru them!
Plane breaks down at the first airport! 3 hour delay! Ok I get it safety first, but when I missed my connecting flight to Auckland! The staff at the Houston airport were terrible! Asked the woman 3 times to speak up because I could not hear a thing she was saying! She would not! She couldn't figure out the international date line either.
Couldn't get on the flight at 915 because we didn't get there til 830pm. Now stuck in Houston for a 22 hour layover!  Got a cheap hotel voucher and $30.00 in food vouchers, but no list of who would accept them. The eye rolls at the name of the hotel warned me it was not a good place!Thank God for the Marriot Airport Hotel!
Filed a complaint with United get offered $200.00 flight voucher! Seriously! My motel I paid for in Queenstown is $279.00 non refunded! That was all I asked! I get well that was a good will gesture! Since most people including me will not use them this crappy airline is out nothing!
Do not fly this airline!!! Book some other airline!!!!"|united
1299|"I fly a lot (domestic and international) so I've seen a lot and realize that not everything is controllable. With United, it's ridiculous. I'm waiting for my flight which was to leave at 10:55 PM from LAX to Boston. Four hours before scheduled depart it posts a delay- okay no problem. The delay is for 1AM. Okay, not excited but it's life. So 3 hour time difference between LA and Boston so I'll be home around 9:30AM. Well, it's 12:30AM and guess where I am, still in LAX airport. United as a whole seems unconcerned with severe delays. I know I do not know all the intricacies of airline management but making clients wait until 1AM with no weather problems just ""we left late"" (that's all the front desk told us) is underwhelming to say the least. Further more they are saying flight may be delayed further. I know this is difficult and all crew members are scheduled in advance, but it would mean much more to patrons if when delays like this happen that an alternate plane is ready on standby to get things moving.

It's very inconvenient and quite ridiculous since this ticket costs more and I am required to pay for my carry on (unlike other airlines). I took American Airlines in and I should have used them to go back. Last time I'm using United.

Update: since my carryon bag was required to be checked I was unable to make the 1040 Logan express therefore I am late to work. Thanks United. I would have taken an earlier flight but jokes on me because there was not one after 5PM which is when my exam ended. Never again."|united
1300|I booked a round-trip flight and was not able to make the outbound flight (was willing to get a  different outbound ticket) and I was told that my entire trip (including the return trip) was now voided. They easily could have let me take the return trip since I already paid for it but wouldn't let me. So now I just lost hundreds of dollars with no refund or credits. One of the worst airline policies and customer service I have ever had. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BOOK with United.|united

1303|In the future, I suggest United provide quicker updates when it comes to rescheduled and cancelled flights. I spent a smooth vacation weekend only to find out my return flight was cancelled less than 24 hours before my scheduled departure time from my Google assistant (not United). I understand there were weather complications that resulted in the cancellation, however, no immediate reason was given behind the cancellation. There should be more efficient alternatives used to cause United passengers the least stress possible. The cancellation ultimately cause a downward ripple effect on my vacation and health which could have been avoided if there were better procedures enacted.|united
1304|"What a merry-go-round of horrors.  I paid over $300 for a ticket that was purchased months in advance for travel with the obligatory Saturday night stay over.  My boarding pass was ENDORSED with a note that I could not take on ANY carry on luggage.  My tiny piece of luggage was banned even though others were entitled to theirs.
I had to pay for my baggage.  To make matters worse, many of those passengers with carry on luggage had to get their bags checked in at the gate.  They got their luggage checked in for free.  I had to pay for mine!  IS THAT FAIR???
They also try to pump passengers for money through registering for advanced seat assignment!
At least with my beloved Southwest, there is no seat assignment.  First come, first served.  PERIOD!
This airline will NEVER see me again."|united
1305|"I don't want to roll over any stars.  My dealing with the airline is a start-to-finish nightmare.  I was in LOVE with Continental, but when United sucked them up, everything went on a rapid decline.  The airline nickel-and-dimes clients for everything (I'm surprised they give you water for free).  Baggage handlers were nasty to me inside the airport and ground attendants would not give me any information about availability of other flights.  They used to let you switch flights for free if there was space available.  KISS THAT GOODBYE.  I had gotten so fed up with everything about them that I told them that I just wanted to give my miles away to a friend.
They told me that I would have to pay for that.  WHAT?  Apparently, you can donate your miles to an organization (a tax break for them), but if you want to give your miles away you have to pay for it.  I told them to just get rid of my miles and to completely remove my name from the data base.  To date I am still in the data base and they refuse to remove me.
I could write more, but why bother?"|united
1306|"The employees at Baggage Claim do not check bag tags if behind they are behind the rope. My bag arrived an hour early and by the time I arrived, it was stolen. The CSR agents are rude and dont care. You are just another number and their bad attitude shows this. When I was waiting for the CSR to sort out my baggage issue, I watched them for an hour not check for bag tags behind the rope. Lastly, with cameras all around LAX, how does the police not have video of the culprit? And not have the ability to find my bag? Im in a long drawn out process waiting for all my lost baggage checks to be approved and reimbursement because these people cant be held accountable for their actions.

This morning I was having issues checking in at the ticket counters and the five people I tried to get help from....oblivious. Only one person can make a decision. No one else can think outside of their bubble.

It appears HR needs to do a better hiring people and/or the United CSRs need a refresh on their customer service training."|united
1307|I recently was on a ground shuttle with a group of United employees; they were going to service a flight from Bozeman to Chicago.  At least one of the group was wearing a cloying perfume.  As I am allergic to perfume, I immediately began coughing.  One member of the group stated that the airline allows their employees to wear perfume while working.  Given that many people have perfume allergies, perhaps travelers need to warned  about this policy.  Most airlines do not serve peanuts anymore as even the odor can  cause an allergic reaction.  Why do they allow their employees to wear perfume?  Thankfully, I was flying Delta.|united
1308|"I just competed the most horrible round trip experience of my life. The trip started out being delayed because they said the plane was overweight they first requested 15 passengers to get off only four did. The four people were offered $750 which is acceptable. After the four people got off we sat on the tarmac for another half an hour so they could check the weight again. Once they did they found it was OK to leave. No I was a hour late to my connecting flight I had to run 65 Gates to get to my connecting flight once I made it to the connecting flight we all had to get off because there was a mechanical issue with the plane. We waited an hour and a half for another plane they said they could not find the other plane, it was missing WTF? We ended up getting to our final destination over 2 1/2 hours late.

On the returning flight we had multiple delays due to weather which is entirely acceptable the flight crew from LA what's acceptable but did nothing overly enjoyable. Known my connecting flight we got 10 minutes from my destination and they turned around due to weather however no one on the flight crew could tell us what to do next so instead of the customer service agent coming to the flight and telling everybody the same exact thing all passengers on the flight waited in the same line and were individually told that United would do nothing for them and we were given a toiletry kit kit to attempt to take off the next day. My only fault in all of this is how United handled everything they do not have the customers needs in mind they do not care about the customer.

Moral of the story do not fly united the company is poorly run and do not care about the needs of the customer."|united

Imagine these are the people you will depend on when your flight encounters a hiccup 35,000 feet off the ground.

1310|"The absolute WORSE experience I have EVER had with an airline! Their employees are extremely disrespectful and not helpful in the slightest! My mom and 80 year old grandmother are traveling together and only two employees were helpful after dealing with about 5 others.

My sister purchased tickets for them a few weeks back and after the purchase received a notification that they would not be allowed a carry on. We called the airline to confirm and they informed us that this was NOT true since the flight was international. My sister explained that they had a layover so the first flight was considered domestic and she was REASSURED that they would be allowed a carryon and not to worry.

Yesterday when printing their boarding passes we noticed their tickets said no carryon so I decided to ask. The attendant was beyond disrespectful and wouldn't even let me finish explaining the situation before rolling her eyes and not even looking at me when I was speaking. At this point I asked if there was anyone else I could speak to, she said she would let him know. Which she did not! My mom politely went to the gentleman and he too was rude. He wouldn't even let my mom explain the situation and kept cutting her off and then insinuated my mom wanted him to break some policy, which was not the situation. I tried explaining that my frustration was not with him but they should really work on being consistent the information they provide.

Once that happen we decided to just go check in the bags they could. At this point my mom wanted to confirm that my grandma would be able to still get her ADA accommodation of a wheelchair and simply asked if she would be charged. The woman at the luggage check in was even more disrespectful than the last woman we dealt with. She laughed at my mom for asking so at this point I became involved and ask if she could just check her bags. Another woman approached and weighed my grandma luggage and informed us it was 3 pounds over. She asked that we go to the back and remove Iran's, which we did. When trying to recheck the bags this woman made the comment of ""oh you better check them they were already trying the get the bag through so who knows now"" as if she didn't see if removing items from the luggage.

The only people that were helpful in this whole situation were the gentleman that finished checking our luggage and the woman that confirmed my grandmas ADA accommodation. We have flown out of the LAX our entire life and this has NEVER happened.

I understand it's a stressful time and working at the  airport is a lot but that does not give anyone the right to be disrespectful to customers, let alone two older women. I have worked in customer service for years and even when frustrated with a customer I would NEVER act this way.

We will never fly united again and hopefully they can better their service."|united
1311|"I've already had 2 flights in a row that were delayed by 1-3 hours.

The first time it happened I failed to receive any text/email/notification; it was only when I was at the airport about to go through security screening that they mentioned to me the flight was delayed. The second time I did receive text/notifications. I'm wary about flying United again.

The food they serve is terrible; they have bad ingredients/preservatives/stabilizers."|united
1312|"United lost my luggage AGAIN.  It is almost comical at this point.  They have screwed things up so often that I try to avoid flying with them whenever possible, and if I have to fly with them I bring everything carry on.  Can't do that with skis, though.  Goodbye skis. They were even marked ""priority"".  I used to be a frequent flyer, and even had their credit card.  But I dumped all that."|united
1313|Checking and boarding super simple. I'd give 5 stars but you can't even take a carry on without being a MileagePlus member. The carry on that's free is a personal item, so take a small one. Attendants were friendly. WiFi for a fee and worked well. In flight direct tv.  No charging ports available so take your extra battery if you need it.|united
1314|Purchased a ticket for a round-trip flight. (I even paid extra to pick my seats.) I'm not checking any bags, or bringing a carry-on. I only travel with small a backpack aka my personal item. Unbeknownst to me, I can't check-in online with United before my flight because I don't have a checked bag. However, the fine folks at United said that if I buy the option to bring a checked bag, I can check-in online. I told them that I don't have a bag to check-in and that LAX is madness right now. I told them I risk missing my flight by taking time to check-in at the airport.  That didn't matter to the. Seems to me that withholding the ability for a customer to check-in online, only to up-sell them to an unnecessary upgrade, is a scam so they can make more money. Very disappointing. Avoid UA for your future air travel needs.|united
1315|"In the midst of a 6 3/4 hour delay for a flight from LAX to ORD on Friday, March 16, I visited the United Customer Service Desk in Terminal 7.  I had an early morning appointment in Grand Rapids that couldn't wait for me to arrive late the following afternoon, and had made alternate travel arrangements from Chicago to Grand Rapids.  

My visit to the United Customer Service Desk was to make sure that my abandoning the ORD-GRR leg would not impact my return trip.  ""No problem - we'll block that leg so you won't be affected"" I was told.  I double-checked to be sure the agent understood what I was doing, and why.

A day ahead of my return trip, I called United, and found out that my return trip had been cancelled, just as I expected.  After a lengthy discussion (""Can you tell me why you didn't make the Saturday flight?"" ""Your flight was inexplicably delayed by 6 3/4 hours, causing me to miss all later connections to Grand Rapids.  I needed to get to an early Saturday appointment, and by the way, I just saved you the cost of a hotel room in Chicago""), they finally restored my return trip.

Oh - by way of apology, today I was offered $50 credit (on United, of course) or 2500 additional frequent flyer miles.  No offer of reimbursement for the ground transportation I required, my imposition on my Chicago friends for pickup at the airport and a place to crash, or any meals from the time I arrived in Chicago to the time of the arrival of the replacement ticket the following day.

I suggest you do not fly with United unless you want to be at the airport waiting for 10+ hours, Miss your connecting flight and loose days of your travel/vacation time.
They also did nothing to accommodate or even apologize for the inconvenience.
Ridiculous and disastrous airline.
It doesn't matter where you're flying to, their flights are always screwed up!"|united

My kids flight to Canada was delayed by 10 hours on July 23. My 82 year old mom is flying to Tampa today to see her dying brother and her flight is delayed by 12 hours. Now she missed her connection in Washington and has to stay in a hotel by herself in a strange city.

1321|"The service on the flight was wonderful, the nightmare are those seats. If you are taller than 5'0"" you are in for a horrible flight due to the seats and the leg room. I thought I would die waiting for the flight to end. I had to ask if I could stand in the galley after my legs had gone numb.

On the flight home we were forced to pay an additional $365 just so we'd have more more leg room but that did not help as the room is barely much more than the blood clot seats and is a rip-off.

It seams the only way to be comfortable is to come out of pocket for the business class (aka 1st Class) just so you can walk when you land.

All airlines need more leg room and wider seats so you and your neighbor don't have to take turns stretching as best you can in the cramped space.

The cost of the fare is already ridiculous and having to pay $1000 more just to be comfortable is a travesty. I've been traveling my entire life and all the airlines have done over the years is make the seats smaller, the space more cramped all the while jacking up the fare and reducing the in flight service.

Staycations are looking more appealing than having to fly."|united
1322|"I don't know why I gave them a second chance. I actually slept in the airport along with a woman who had been there for two days trying to get to her dying son. They are not big on customer service and they certainly don't take care of people inconvenienced by their incompetence. Not even a bottle of water. We actually almost also missed our final flight because they boarded early. We thought we were early. Our tickets said 6:05 boarding. We got there at 5:59 and they were calling last call. Huh? After spending the night at LAX, had I missed my connecting flight, that would not have been a good scene. Never again, United. The unfriendly skies. The luggage made it though. One star for the luggage handlers. They seem to have it together!

And to that sorry excuse of a man that wouldn't give the marine his seat, yeah, you're still a little you know what. Seems to fit! Karma will get you I'm sure."|united

1325|I am really thankful for every airline (and for their brave crews!) who serve their clients in these time, where politicians update and change decisions about risk territories on a daily base. Which makes the airline and tourism business unnecessary challenging. We just had a super convenient and safe flight to Barcelona. The only thing I did not like, was that the toilet near the cockpit is now exclusively reserved for the crew. So I had to move all the way through the cabin from my front row seat to the rear where there was a line waiting - that does not seem to be a logical or smart new measure by Vueling in Covid-19 times.|vueling-airlines
1326|"Eine besonders perfide Masche bringt Vueling gerade, um eh schon Corona-genervten Kunden das Geld aus der Tasche zu ziehen. Anstatt jetzt - wie ja vom Gesetzheber her moeglich - endlich den Flugplan wieder hochzufahren, werden jeden Tag einzelne Flüge gestrichen. Und dann den Kunden ""grosszügig"" angeboten, auf einen anderen Vueling Flug am selben Tag umzubuchen. Soweit wäre das ja OK. Doch die Umbuchung bei Vueling geht leider in's Leere - wird absichtlich nicht supported. Weder Online, noch von der der Hotline (da geht nämlich einfach niemand dran). Und was machen dann die Kunden aus Panik, an dem Tag doch noch irgendwie fliegen zu können? Richtig: sie buchen brav einen anderen Vueling an demselben Tag ihrer Buchung. Der natürlich das doppelte kostet, wie der ursprünglich gebuchte Flug. Mein Tipp: lassen Sie sich von Vueling nicht für dumm verkaufen. Buchen Sie ihren neuen Flug bei einer anderen Airline (wie ich bei Ryanair). Und holen Sie sich Ihr Geld von Vueling über ein Flugrechteportal wie zurück. Denn freiwillig kommt von Vueling sowieso keine Erstattung."|vueling-airlines

1330|"""Expectation is the mother of all frustration.""
- Antonio Banderas

In between my British Airways flights, I caught Vueling, an economy airlines based in Spain. I ignored the overall bad reviews and took a chance with the low fare and ¡Hoy! Spanish Movie Star flight schedule;)

Like Antonio said I had little expectations boarding my flight. Yet, I found Vueling exceeding what the reviews said. My flight from Paris (CDG) to Barcelona (BCN) via Airbus. Flight crew was friendly and professional. And the flight itself was smooth with no delays. Solid 4-Stars!

In the end, I'd fly Vueling again with no hesitation. Just don't expect Boujee as it's simply a ""puddle jumper"" to get from one European country to the next. To me, it was a perfect choice for short travel in between my long British Airways intercontinental flights. Te Amo;)"|vueling-airlines
1331|"Well, during this difficult time globally, it's hard to write a negative review for a company. But Vueling has made it easier for me.

We booked a short flight from Venice to Barcelona a while ago, way before the Coronavirus was a threat to anyone. So when this virus spread across the world rapidly, out first thought is perhaps we need to cancel. But as weeks passed, the situation in Europe have gotten worse. Both countries: Italy and Spain are on lockdown. Plus, our flight from Los Angeles to Europe was cancelled by the airline, and the government of Spain has aggressively advise against flying unless it's absolutely necessary. With all these factors in place, Vueling Airlines still claims our booked flight is on schedule.

On top of that, their website is confusing. It does not allow ticketholders to change a booking, nor allow us to request a refund to original form of payment. I took it to their Facebook page and learned there are A LOT of very upset customers in the same boat. Some who said even 2 days before the scheduled flight into Italy, their webpage still says it's on time, even though the entire country is on lockdown.

The consensus is Vueling is playing tricks, purposely not canceling any flights so they would not have to refund any money, hoping the customer will cancel and lose out. Also, they only offer vouchers that needs to be used by the end of 2020, which apparently is not allowed accordng to Spain's Aviation Agency (see photo)

Needless to say, no one that's been given the runaround by this airline holding the funds will be flying with them, ever.

Note: This review is dated March 24, 2020. For people reading this far into the future, we're going through the Coronavirus that's affecting the entire globe."|vueling-airlines
1332|"We already had one bad experience in Vegas, so whenever any flight announces that flight is 30 Minutes late or 1 hr late, we get scared easily whether it will fly or not. And the thing with budget airlines is they don't care much I guess.

We had a flight with Vueling VY6106 Barcelona to Rome at 6:20 PM. We reached the terminal, did security and were standing in the boarding line. The flight was 2 hrs. Late and I was scared about the same outcome. And here they announced, the flight is canceled. Run to the main counter, there I feel like I am in some sort of competition, if I do not reach on time, I won't get the next day flight and that's true. You have to be in the line ahead then others, otherwise chances are you won't get the same/next day flight.

We were on the Europe tour and our Rome itinerary was fixed and the next cities (Venice-Florence-Pisa and 3 more), every city's itinerary was connected. We even told them at the counter that gives me any flight, but they were no help. Our next day in Rome got wasted completely.

Though they provided hotel accommodation and meals, that's not what I wanted (between hotel was 60 Km from the airport, it took 1 hour, but it was good and food was also good, so no complaint in that). Horrible experience with Vueling, I know it's the case with all the airlines and no one is 100% perfect but at least give us the reason. They just said technical glitch and that's it. They gave the next day noon VY 6104 flight and we reached our Airbnb in Rome at 5 pm. ( I am still in touch with those sites who says "" file claim with us and we 'll help you)

The flight was okay. Leg space was okay too. I am 5'10"". We ordered in-flight food. The price was really low considering it's in an air meal. We ordered the club sandwich and chicken rice. Food was okay, anyway your taste buds do not work 100% so high in the air."|vueling-airlines
1333|"We took Vueling to Tenerife today.  Within the terminal, they didn't tell us the gate number until 7 minutes before boarding, talk about cutting it close.

We were on an Airbus A320 and they bused us there on the tarmac. The plane was pretty clean, and the seats, although not reclinable, were comfy.

Flight attendants were nice and helped people get on."|vueling-airlines
1334|The worst customer service!! AVOID at all costs!! I am trying to get my refund for 3 months already and they keep telling me lies, that they have some IT errors, that I need to call back later, refund didn't come through. Today they told me that they issued me a flight credit instead and they cannot reverse it and get me my money back. Why would I need a flight credit with such a horrible company??! i am definitely not booking any flights with them again.|vueling-airlines
1335|"I received an email from Vueling notifying me I can receive a refund in the form of airline credit as the flight was canceled due to COVID.

I am in the US and they make it terribly hard to contact them via phone and website contact form to claim the credit.

Finally I was able to submit a claim 24 hours before the date of the flight.
After all of that I received a reply saying they couldn't give me a credit for some BS reason.

I won't be using this airline again."|vueling-airlines
1336|"DO NOT TAKE VUELING AIR! DO NOT TAKE VUELING AIR! DO NOT TAKE VUELING AIR!

This may be more of a lesson to always get travel insurance, but nonetheless...I've rode my fair share of budget airlines without any significant problems. My flight from Rome to Barcelona, departing at 9pm, was cancelled. The Vueling representatives were anything but transparent about the reason (only that it was ""outside of their control""). Begrudgingly, they booked me on another flight, departing 48 HOURS later! Had I taken this flight, I would have missed my connecting flight back to the U.S. Hence, I was forced to book a flight for the next morning and a hotel for $400. It was too late to find a cheaper hotel in the city, especially since I was traveling alone.

While I received a refund for my fare from Vueling, I did not receive any compensation for my checked bags fee. In fact, I received my checked bag back two hours after the flight while cancelled...BROKEN AND OPEN! I lost some of my items and did not receive any compensation whatsoever. Vueling customer service is a nightmare. I even tried speaking in Spanish, but they just hang up the phone when you demand to speak to their manager. And, since I'm in the U.S. and all I can do is call them, there's else nothing I can do but warn others against taking this horrible airline service."|vueling-airlines

Vueling lost three of our luggage's, there is no money in the world that can replace what I have!! I'm still hoping they find it... but i'm not confident because they don't communicate well... then i'm stuck with international bills trying to call them.. I hope someone reads this and all reviews and do not use Vueling!"|vueling-airlines
1338|"So I had to fly vueling because that was the airplane operating my Iberia flight between Barcelona and Sevilla.

I actually had a good in flight experience - seats were spacious and comfortable and enough leg room . Stewardesses were nice

----------
The only person that was an A-hole to me was the man at the gate .  The whole process for the tax refund is such a pain in the azzzz . They make scan papers before security and the. After security you have to stand on a long line to get your refund. I was due back a large sum . I basically ran to the gate and just as I arrived - the man said it was closed although there were stand bys waiting to board . This little short bald man was so mean to me. Made me feel as if I was going to miss my flight . I even had a little asthma because I ran and started to cry. This man had no sympathy. The other employees were trying to update me . So this man let all the standbys go in before me- which I wasn't mad about because I was late - but why be so mean to me?  Even at last minute - when they allowed me to board . He says "" pase pase"" with such disdain. I have never been treated so horribly on a flight. It wasn't like I wasn't sorry or I had an attitude either . I will never forget this experience that this ONE man gave me

If I didn't have this experience- I would have give 3-4 stars ."|vueling-airlines
1339|"I like Vueling (Vueling), a very good lowcost airline in Europe!
We flew in May 2019 twice - from Paris to Barcelona and from Barcelona to Majorca and both times we were satisfied.

What you need to know about them?
How to buy tickets for Vueling.
You can through the application Skyscanner or Vueling (or their website).
Their website really slows down, but you need to wait, because the desktop version has many features that are not in the mobile application.

Staff.
the staff is friendly, if at the airport you don't manage to do something yourself, they immediately help.

Luggage.
Here is what is written on their website:

and further:

and finally:

However, they do not find fault if the weight of the luggage is more than 10 kg, I had 14 kg and they did not check.

They have 3 types of tariff - Basic, Optima, Timeflex.
We took two tariffs, as my wife had two baggage - hand luggage and a bag of 20 kg (shopping in paris and barcelona), and I only have hand luggage.

I bought myself a Basic fare (hand baggage 10 kg) + paid extra for choosing a seat (to sit next to my wife), and I took Optima to my wife (hand baggage 10 kg + checked baggage 25 kg + choice of seat).

After payment, the confirmation arrived and the boarding tickets immediately arrived.
They can be printed, but you can also not print, you can simply register through the QR code on the phone, which we did.
The ticket shows how to fold it, everything is very simple and convenient.

Seat selection.

The cost of choosing a seat depends on a number of:
21-25 rows - 4 euros.
16-20 rows - 5 euros.
11-15 rows - 6 euros.
10 row - 14 euros (20% more space here).
Front rows (5-9 rows) - 9 euros.
Space Plus (More space and priority landing - 2, 3, 4 rows) - 17 euros.
Space One (More space (+ 20%) and priority landing - only 1 row 1 st) - 21 euros.
I paid extra for 8-15 places, in terms of saving these are the best places.
The choice of Basic fare + seat extra charge was cheaper than buying Optima tariff.
Therefore, if you do not have large luggage, choose this rate.

The accuracy of the flight.
Both times that we flew this airline, the flights were on time.

Food.
Both times we flew for short distances, so there was no power.

Advice - if you are hungry, buy yourself a meal in advance at the supermarket, as the airports are more expensive.
If you don't care about money, you can eat at the airport or on board Vueling.

Cons of the airline.

1 - the seats do not recline, because of this, that it takes up space, because the airline simply rammed a lot of seats in the cabin.
But! My legs are comfortable (I have a height of 175 cm, but there were people in the salon and they were 180-185 meters tall and they were clearly not uncomfortable).
Since the flights are short - 1-2 hours, this does not cause discomfort, in extreme cases, you can walk through the cabin.

2 - when buying tickets of two different fares, like with us (Basic + Optima), you cannot choose two fares at once, you must first buy a ticket for one fare, because again find the same flight and buy a ticket for it.
And what if there are only a few tickets left on this flight and everyone wants to buy it?
Then one of you will fly (who already bought a ticket), and the other can stay.
Therefore, it is necessary to do all this very quickly, within 1-2 minutes.
It is best to import all of your data and your partner / friend / wife to their website, then the program itself adds it.
Here is such a minus for this application, by the way on their website the same problem.

Summary - if you want to choose a low-cost airline in Europe, choose Vueling."|vueling-airlines
1340|"They are a terrible airline, the customer service is unhelpful aka less than USELESS.  The initial flight arrived 3 hours late, I was told that the connecting flight was also late so no problem making the connection.  The connecting flight was only 30 min late and had left before we had arrived in Barcelona.  We were instructed to wait in line (75 min wait) then told sorry we had to exit the departure area to the ticket area customer service -  wait in line (55 min wait); then told sorry we had to go to a special 'missed connection' line; wait in line (210  min wait) then told sorry no flight out till Tuesday -- it was Saturday and no they would not put me on another airline, oh and there was a possibility that the flight on Tuesday would be cancelled.

1341|"If I can give this air line minus, I would. Terrible customer service phone, gate. They put wrong gate on the screen and make us run from D gate to  C gate in Fiumchini Rome. We have been flying from US to London to Rome but our carry on luggages with no problem. But this airline will try to get our money by making us pay $50 per carry on. The gate agent threaten to call police on us to make us miss our flight. I booked my tickets with travelocity with 24 hours free cancelation but they did not honor it.

Travelocity told me go ahead to file a claim with them but I just wanted to give this airline my business but PLEASE DO NOT fly with this airline. My friend flew from Split Croatia to Rome on 7/1/19. Her flight was delayed 4 hours.

1 word TERRIBLE."|vueling-airlines
1342|"Pay the extra $50-100 if you can manage. This was the worst flight experience of my life. Vueling Air almost cost us our honeymoon, definitely cost us the opening World Cup match, a beautiful hotel, and an entire day in Paris.

It was an absolute nightmare from checking in to landing. I could write a Russian novel on the complete and total ineptitude of this airline, but I will summarize why you should avoid this airline at all costs:

1. Check in line was absolute chaos. People had no idea where to be, who to talk to, and how long it would take to get boarding passes. It took one hour to get boarding passes

2. This delay forced a horde of passengers to make a mad dash to the gate as the airport screens indicated that boarding would be closed within minutes
3. We all get to the gate in a frenzied state only to be told that our flight was delayed by one hour

4. We wait for an hour at the gate. No word from the 2 Vueling employees on where our plane is and how much longer we will have to wait

5. After 2 hours had passed, the employee announced that our 1:00 PM flight had been delayed to 9:00 PM...audible gasps and shock fill the room. People flood the two employees

6. The employees indicate that we can get food vouchers $12 per person at the Information desk

7. The two Vueling employees get their bags and leave the gate as they are at the end of their shift. No explanation on why there was a delay. We are told by one sympathetic employee, ""good luck and keep on checking the screens.""

8. Because it took them 2 hours to inform us that the flight was significantly delayed, options for the Eurostar and another flight are impossible. We are forced to wait until 9 PM without any degree of certainty as to whether or not the flight would be canceled

9. Around 8 PM a large group is forming near the Information desk about the status of our 9 PM flight. The woman at the info desk told us to call the Vueling number (which went straight to voicemail, btw) and to keep checking screens for updates on cancellations

10. The woman at the info desk leaves for the night. The large group continues to wait until another British Airways employee says our flight should be good to go at 10 PM. They are just waiting on another plane flying from Portugal

11. No word for another hour until the screen changes and our flight is scheduled to leave at 11 PM. There are no employees at the gate.

12. At 11:30 PM, two exasperated employees come to the gate to begin checking in passengers. One of the employees got into an argument with the other employee and exclaimed, ""I QUIT!"" and left the ticketing gate within 10 minutes. There is now only 1 employee checking folks in

13. We finally board at midnight and arrive in Paris at 2 AM

My issue is not with the delay as to how Vueling absolutely failed to provide any level of transparency or communication to its passengers. Look, I know this is not a top airline, but it is completely unacceptable to treat your customers this way. By stringing us all along for hours, they robbed us of any other choice.

My husband and I missed the opening match of the Women's World Cup ($400) and essentially an entire day of our honeymoon. We are now attempting to be compensated for our losses and Vueling is not cooperating despite EU laws and their own policy regarding delayed flights. I cannot believe they are allowed to still be in business.

You can take your chances with this airline. If you are not in any hurry, have no need to be anywhere at any particular time, or just want to try your luck, I am sure you will be one of the positive reviewers on this site. You just have to be aware that this airline has a lengthy track record of being wholly incompetent. We saw those reviews and still took our chances. It did not pay off.

I wish I could go back in time and just fork the extra dollars for a better flight. Lesson learned."|vueling-airlines
1343|"We booked Vueling from Grenada to Barcelona in September. The flights came to about $150 for the two of us. We booked a 10:45pm flight and it was delayed by about an hour. I assumed it would be delayed so we were happy that it wasn't delayed several hours! Carry on bags were free and we paid an extra $10 to check in early.

So now to the issues...

My bf was sick (cold/cough) and I was fine. We both had a lot of problems with the cabin pressure in the airplane. It was the most horrible pressure I've ever felt in my ears. We've flown on LONNNG flights and never had a problem with other airlines. It was not a smooth ride, the captain made tons of dips and turns. It was a very weird overall.

When we landed my ears unblocked after a while but my bf had trouble for days. Since he was sick the cabin pressure problem caused fluid to get trapped in his ears. Luckily, it eventually resolved itself.

Vueling is cheap and that's the only thing they have going for them. I would NOT recommend flying on their airplanes if you are sick."|vueling-airlines

I spent 200$ in calls last September and October to vueling's customer care.  Nobody knows what their doing; I was transferred, hung up on, simply put, nobody cared.  In December vueling finally transferred to me 250$.  This company are crooks!  Someone in their company stole my bag, and a part of my vacation, and Vueling made sure I ate all the costs.

When I asked for REFUND, they REFUSED, stating that the flight was canceled because of circumstances beyond their control. I can say the exact same thing; MY trip was canceled for circumstances beyond MY control. They again REFUSED to REFUND my money. This is unacceptable. People are losing their jobs; trying to deal with unemployment and these companies, like Vueling Airlines think they have the right to keep people's money for a service they did NOT provide is just SHAMEFUL!

1349|"Consummately late with often no reasons given until 30 minutes after you've already been delayed and no consideration given to the passengers. Once was delayed just about 3 hours at the Rome airport and they didn't give a reason (spoiler alert: it wasn't the weather) and they didn't provide any compensation to the travelers.

Last week, same thing. Was on a flight to Barcelona and the flight was delayed an hour for no obvious reason. No wonder they have a pre-recorded apology message they play at the end of each flight.  

I would suggest picking another airline, but in Europe you're often stuck with limited options so I don't really know what to say."|vueling-airlines
1350|"I feel for those who had poor travel experiences, but Rome to Barcelona with a close-in booking on Vueling was one of the best airport experiences I've ever had.

The boarding process was swift and smooth and they gate-checked our carry-ons for us with no hassle at all. The entire staff is VERY friendly, the plane was extremely clean and comfortable (even though the seat does not recline), and the onboard announcements were made in multiple languages.  

I would definitely book with Vueling again in a heartbeat."|vueling-airlines
1351|"Vueling is a Barcelona based low-cost airline offering cheap flights to, from and within Spain. As with any low-cost airline you should carefully read their conditions before you buy a ticket (you agree to those conditions!). You will pay extra fees (very high fees!) for everything: changing passengers' names, changing flights' times, cabin baggage that doesn't fit into their gauge, food and drinks on board etc.

Assume you can't return the ticket when you buy it - changing anything is often more expensive than buying a new ticket.

Vueling is the world's record holder for the number of passengers flying together in an Airbus 320 plane at the same time (source: my guess). It can be a real torture if you are tall and the flight is long.

The personnel is very friendly and polite which partly  compensates the inconveniences of the flight.

Register on their website to collect points (""puntos"") if you are a frequent flyer. Vueling is not part of any airline alliance, they have a loyalty program of their own.

Vueling is your choice in Spain if:
- you are able to read long texts (and understand what you are reading :) )
- you are able to measure and weigh your cabin bag and understand if it will be allowed
- you are able to plan well and you rarely change your plans
- you have no check-in baggage
- you are shorter than average

1352|The absolute WORST airline I have ever traveled on!!! Flight delayed 3 hours. Poor customer service and an extreme lack of organization. The staff does not care about the passengers!!!|vueling-airlines
1353|Again, like so many others who reviewed this BS airline, I'd give it a minus 10 gazillion. I bought this ticket because my son wanted to extend his stay. It was the cheapest I could find. They didn't tell me they don't: provide food, attendants with manners, nor blankets. What they did do was turn the A/C on so high that the passengers were forced to BUY blankets!! What is that?? They force you to buy blankets because they turn the air up so high! My son could see the air coming out of the units. Ridiculous. Never again. When he wanted some water, he walked to the back and asked for some, the attendant points to the water. No smile, no words, just a point. Absolutely crazy. I realize the attendants aren't paid that well, but don't take it out on the poor, freezing passengers.|vueling-airlines
1354|"The Vueling website automatically booked me on a return flight I did not need, and charged me for it. I was traveling without an international phone plan, and couldn't call the customer service number -- and the website offers no option to seek help online. The return flight -- which, again, I didn't ask for and didn't need, but have still been charged for -- departs tomorrow. Today, upon returning to the US, I called the helpline. The person who answered the phone was INCREDIBLY rude. She insisted there is an online customer service option (there isn't, at least not on the mobile website), and that I should have contacted them within two hours of making the booking (which was the first I had heard of any two-hour window). She then refused multiple times to allow me to speak to a superior, and hung up on me.

This is by far the most disgraceful display of customer service I've encountered from any airline, anywhere in the world, ever. As far as I'm concerned, Vueling Airlines robbed me.

And by the way, when we got to the airport their baggage check-in system was down, and half the passengers almost missed the plane.

Customer Service is non-existent and if you find a rep, they want to get rid of you by strongly suggesting for you to go online
Vueling's website does not offer an online chat nor provides travelers with an email for customer support
Our flight from Ibiza to Barcelona was cancelled in July 2019 and we learned about this cancellation after several hours of waiting at the gate. The airline reps at the gate said different stories to travelers about the delay.
Due to flight cancellation after several hours of wait at the gate at around 4am early morning, we were offered to go a hotel. Out of pocket expenses for taxi and food were not reimbursed
We were advised to submit all of our expenses online for reimbursement and request compensation for cancellation. Our claim was denied because the airline claimed that the cancellation occurred due to unforeseen reasons
Food is for sale on the trip so it adds up when you do your math"|vueling-airlines
1358|"Very rude staff at the checkin counter. Horrible service.

We received two emails that the flight was delayed for 2 hours and we therefore arrived at the airport later than we originally planned. At the checkin, we were blamed for arriving late, and were refused to check in our luggage.

Did not waste time to argue. Never using again no matter how cheap tickets are."|vueling-airlines
1359|"Error made in my name (changed to random words somehow?). I email them the same day I booked it and they email me back 5 days later, saying that changes can be made in the first 24 hours only, unless I pay $60. Go ahead and check the date on their response email.

After spending an hour on the phone with them after this, they literally hung up on me. Wouldn't change my name unless I paid.

I will never, ever fly this airline again, and I suggest you avoid them at all costs.

If you check my review on Trip Advisor you can see the screenshots of my emails to and from them."|vueling-airlines
1360|"My partner and I arrived at the Barcelona airport about an hour before our domestic flight. We asked two Vueling employees where to check in for our flight, and they pointed us to the self-checkin machines. We tried to check in, and the machine did not work. So we asked another employee, and she pointed us towards the ONE open checkin window manned by a Vueling employee. There was a line of about 30 people, all waiting at this one window. (Meanwhile, there were at least 5 other unmanned windows.)

While waiting in the line for over 20 minutes, we tried to use the machines AGAIN, and they didn't work AGAIN. When we finally got to the front of the line at 1:29, the employee told us that we could not get on the flight because checkin had closed at 1:25. She told us we should have gone to last minute check-in around the corner. NO ONE TOLD US THIS OPTION EXISTED. Three different employees failed to give us the correct information, and checkin closed while we were waiting in line to check in.

When we went to the customer service window, the Vueling employee refused to put us on a later flight for free, and instead tried to charge us over 200 euros. He was incredibly rude and insulted us multiple times, saying that we were lying about what time we arrived at the airport.

We were not allowed on the flight because a series of incompetent employees did not give us the right information, and because there were multiple checkin machines that simply did not work.

To top it all off? I tried to file a claim on their website, but it DOES NOT WORK, in multiple browsers. I called their number, and the woman told me to use the website to file a claim. When I told her the website doesn't work and that's why I was calling, she hung up on me.

Vueling is a terrible excuse for an airline with the worst ""customer service"" I have ever encountered."|vueling-airlines
1361|"Canceled my flight from Nice to
Barcelona. They canceled the same for 3 days in a row. Very unprofessional if this was an American company they would be sued and bankrupt. Also they do not want to refund my money even though they did not give me any solutions in order to go back to Barcelona.

1363|"The flight on Vueling was fine. I double booked on Vueling to get around the recent violent protests  in Barcelona.  I tried to cancel my original flight and couldn't, so I kept it. Then I tried to cancel the 2nd flight and couldn't. I explained this to Vueling several times to no avail. ""Sorry we are not responsible for protests."" Vueling showed no empathy, no compromise, no flexibility. I am out $300, but Vueling is out a customer and bad press."|vueling-airlines
1364|"My companion and I purchased the premium seats for a flight from Ibiza to Barcelona. upon checking in on the premium line we realized that bags were in fact not included in the price. The Frenchman who checked us and was also pretty rude about the fact that we were in the wrong line and had not paid for bags. We definitely thought we have paid for bags with our premium seats and if we hadn't we wouldn't have purchased them. paying for bags at the check-in cost us twice but it would have if we had bought bags hours in advance. It cost about 60 u.s. dollars to ship each regular sized suitcase. Upon reading reviews it looks like they make it intentionally hard to purchase baggage fees in advance.
The flight was delayed at least 30 minutes and the wait at baggage claim was long.
The flight attendants weren't particularly courteous either. It must not be a fun airline to work for because nobody seems happy.
Be careful for this rude couple."|vueling-airlines
1365|DO NOT FLIGHT THROUGH VUELING. They are the worst airlines ever. They made me pay for an additional flight because they messed up on our reservation. Save the headache, time, and money this airlines will cost you.|vueling-airlines
1366|They lost my luggage. I was without luggage for 6 days. They don't have a good computer system on where the luggage is. Customer Service sucks. Bad experience. The customer service on the plane was also not great.|vueling-airlines
1367|"As a person absolutely terrified of flying, I was already stressed before my flight after reading the reviews.
Flying back to Amsterdam from Florence, I had another panic attack on board and decided to stand by the galley as there it felt less bumpy.

A flight attendant noticed how scared and nervous I was and offered me tea, water and said she would stay with me there. For the remaining hour of the flight, she sat with me in the galley and spoke about several things to calm me down and to ensure me that nothing bad will happen during a flight and that the clouds and wind are normal. When it was 15min before landing she walked me to my seat and again told me that everything was okay.

I did not expect that a no frills airline would have such great customer service and have to say that I am thankfull to have met this flight attendant."|vueling-airlines
1368|"DO NOT FLY THIS AIRLINE. I AM CONVINCED THIS AIRLINE STOLE MY LUGGAGE AND THEY SHOULD BE PUT OUT OF BUSINESS FOR MANY REASONS. IF I COULD GIVE ZERO STARS, I WOULD.

This is the WORST airline I have ever flown. I flew on July 20th, 2019 from Los Angeles to Barcelona. I picked up my bag in Barcelona from Norweigan airlines, and checked it with Vueling for my connecting flight to Naples, Italy. When I arrived in Italy, my suitcase was not there. No-one could tell me where it was and the Naples airport had me file a claim but was not helpful. I did not have any of my belongings in a foreign country and had to buy clothes and toiletries in Positano, Italy. I called Naples and they did not know where my bag was. After 5 days it is the responsibility of the airline to find it- every time I called Vueling while out of the US they were very unhelpful. THEY SAID NAPLES AIRPORT WAS RESPONSIBLE TO FIND MY BAG AND NAPLES AIRPORT SAID IT WAS THE AIRLINES RESPONSIBILITY.  

I came back from my trip on July 29th still without my suitcase. I called Vueling everyday in August resulting in  a $400 phone bill, as I would be on the phone for at least 30 mins daily. Every time I called, I spoke with  new person who said they were putting notes in their system and then when I spoke with a new person the next day, they had no notes. I would ask for a supervisor and they would not transfer me, said a supervisor was only available for sales calls. At one point I demanded to speak to a supervisor and threatened legal action, and the woman on the phone laughed at me and hung up. They paid me $385 for the cost of my bag when they contents totaled $5000! They are supposed to give me 50 euro a day for 5 days for receipts and they DID NOT PAY ME for this, eventhough I spent a lot more than that! I flew to NY or business and spoke with the IBERIA luggage counter who owns VUELING and they told me that when looking at my record VUELING HAD NOT DONE ANYTHING TO FIND MY BAG AND THERE WERE NO NOTES IN THE SYSTEM AND IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE ANYONE HAD DONE ANYTHING TO FIND MY BAG. He addd all the info to my account, said these notes went to the HIGH UP SUPERVISORS, and they would respond, 30 days later, I still have not heard anything.

It has now been almost 100 days, which is when Vueling says they will stop looking for a lost bag. They treat Americans terribly, I know this because I had my friend call in Spanish and they were very nice to them compared to the customer service I received, speaking English. ALL OF MY FAVORITE THINGS ARE GONE AND I HAVE NOT BEEN COMPENSATED PROPERLY AND I WAS GIVEN THE FEELING THAT NOONE FROM VUELING CARES THAT MY STUFF HAS JUST GONE MISSING WHEN IT WAS LAST IN THEIR HANDS. I would highly recommend not flying this airline."|vueling-airlines
1369|This piece of crap airline should be put out of business. Run by criminals and its gate staff are nasty little thugs. The return date on my ticket was defaulted through Vueling's terrible website. When I wanted to change the date to the correct one, I was charged an extra $200 with no option for refund. Gate agents were making fun - and perhaps they didn't know I speak Spanish. Putas. If this operation were running in the U.S., it would be grounded forever. NEVER, EVER, EVER fly this airline.|vueling-airlines
1370|Horrible customer service followed by terrible gate attendants you ruined my day trip to Madrid but I was able to rebook on Iberia airlines where they were nothing short of amazing|vueling-airlines
1371|We flew Vueling round-trip from Barcelona to Palma. Such a disorganized boarding process. Plus, the attendant was rude to my husband. Our baggage also took forever to come out! Inefficient airline.|vueling-airlines
1372|The planes are new and that is where the good part ends.  The flight VY6864 from Florence to Sicily left an hour late but that's not the worse part. The worse part is when we arrived we were stuck on the plane for another 35-40 mins because the door was stuck.  If you have no other options use them but if you have a choice go with another airline.|vueling-airlines
1373|"Booked  a flight from Nice France to Barcelona on Vueling for a weekend holiday.  
The morning of our flight we got an email that Vueling was canceling our flight due to technical reasons.  
I attempted to rebook on the next available flight but it was already full.  
This resulted in a last minute cancellation fee with my hotel in Barcelona and I was told by Vueling that this flight qualified  for compensation of $250.  
I filled out the online compensation form and received a request for my bank account info so they could transfer my compensation directly into it.  I provided this info and no $$$.  
Both of my travel companions received their compensation into their  bank accounts but not me.  
I called Vueling and they said I didn't get mine because I entered a USA bank account and  there  is a different email form needed for that.  They emailed me the form and I submitted it, again no $$$.  I submitted it again and received an email from Vueling stating that no compensation is due for my flight.  

Both of my travel companions that were booked on this same  flight received compensation and I was told multiple times that it did qualify.  I have the emails and paper trail to prove all of this.  When I call Vueling they say they will transfer my concern to the correct department and will hear back but I never do.  This airline is a total scam ran by criminals.  If you are an American you have no protection."|vueling-airlines
1374|Giving this a one because of the fact that they have flights every 2-3 hours usually from all around Spain. It's basically the spirit airlines of Spain. There's no food there's no tv there's space it's a tiny little aircraft that gets you from one place to another.  You have only a carry on and anything else they will charge you for of you miss your flight your going to have to buy another one there's no putting you on the next one|vueling-airlines
1375|"One Yelp reviewer mentioned ""If you have the overwhelming longing to experience life as a sardine then Vueling Airlines is for you!"" which I only took to be rather clever and witty. Big mistake. Silly me, because when I took flight on Vueling I quickly discovered his statement to in fact be a dire warning. Best I can say my flight experience is, being relatively small person, 5'10"" and 168lbs, I was luckier than most. The plane was an Airbus 319-100, a plane which I have been on before, but found this one much different. It had far more seats than the others and the seats had a pitch forward angel to them which I think might have been a design intended to contort you in such a manner as to allow an inch or two of additional leg room. The small seat size however did give some comic relief to my situation when watching some others attempting their best to squirm into seats far too small for their body size. Fortunately I was on a rather short flight from Florence to Barcelona, hence able to suffer through and endure it.

My check-in and baggage handling went smoothly enough and I found the flight crew to be polite, pleasant and understanding of the situation but which, of course, they could do nothing about.

Basically Vueling is a low priced discount carrier, but in order to be that, they've really cut the comfort of their seating to the extreme."|vueling-airlines
1376|This company stole hundreds of dollars from me, and will not get my future business -  hopefully not yours either. A counter person in ticketing booked me for the wrong date. When I arrived at the airport, I did not have a flight and was stuck in a foreign country, unless I was willing to pay high, last minute fare. When I asked Vueling to fix the mistake, I was told my only option is to pay for a new ticket, which costs over $400 euros.  As if $400 is no big deal. #vueling #boycottvueling #vuelingsucks #donotusevueling #vuelingonestar|vueling-airlines
1377|Horrible company. The luggage from the whole airplane was lost. After landing in PMI the baggage info was showing Belt 5. The passengers were waiting for over an hour. The belt never started. Then the note on the screen disappeared. People started running around. Someone found out that Iberia office may have information. All people lined up to claim the lost luggage. We were given a reference number. After one day the website was showing that the search is still under way. Later I heard from others that Vueling is notorious for the lost luggage. I will never fly with Vueling again.|vueling-airlines
1378|"I would have given them a 0 if possible! They lost our bags from Paris to Rome 2 days ago and we still haven't seen them. What a way to treat people on their honeymoon! They say our bags are in Paris but their system can't send them for a few days yet! WTF?!?

Update!!! 10 days later the idiots at vueling still don't know where our bags are. DO NOT USE THIS WORTHLESS STUPID COMPANY!!!"|vueling-airlines
1379|Vueling is the worst airline flying today. They lose luggage, cancel flights, and overbook, leaving customers out in the cold. They've promised to pay me two claims since June and all they do is stall and lie. Avoid Vueling like the plague.|vueling-airlines
1380|"The airline agent who was manning the line to the desk told me that there were no seats left on the plane even though my ticket was paid for and I was early to the airport. When I reached the desk however, there was no word on any type of seat shortage. They should definitely try to put travelers at ease instead of lying for no reason.

Other than that, the flight was decent. I suppose that on short flights (2 hours), they do not offer water or any beverages. Smooth ride though, so 2 stars is the max!"|vueling-airlines
1381|This is another cheap airlines so know what you are putting yourself before you book. There is a charge for luggage good thing carry-on is free. You will not be served anything so be willing to buy on the flight or buy from the airport better yet get you and your full stomach to the airport. They have different prices if you are booking directly with them if you have a check in luggage or prefer a selected seat for leg room or comfort book the one that provided thoes things. If you are backpacking through Europe or you are on a budget then book the one that is cheaper. They have frequent flight so that is a plus.|vueling-airlines
1382|"Recently flew Vueling for the first time, between AMS and BCN. I had gotten a super cheap Delta nonstop roundtrip between PDX and AMS, but needed a way to get to my final destination of Barcelona.

Despite the plethora of negative reviews, I decided to give Vueling a chance but made sure to give myself a very long AMS layover.

It was okay, but it seems that I was also lucky in that there were no delays or cancelled flights.  

That being said, I will likely use KLM next time for these reasons:

1)  Vueling does not have a transfer desk at AMS, so I had to ""leave"" the airport, collect my checked bag, and then wait for the check-in desk to open hours later to get back in for my flight. Although staff were at the check-in desk they refused to open until about an hour before the flight, which meant rushing through security.

2)  I had paid extra for a lounge pass. But the lounge was located so far from the Vueling gates as to render it useless -- since by the time I got back through check-in and to the gate, there wasn't much time left til the flight.

3)  From what I saw and from what I've read, I wouldn't trust the staff to handle a bad situation well, and one can't count on always being lucky."|vueling-airlines
1383|Horrible company. Overbooked our flight from Munich to Barcelona by 8 people and booted us because we didn't check in online - their website wouldn't let us online! Attendants were extremely unhelpful. Vueling ruined our vacation. Never again.|vueling-airlines
1384|"Vueling moved my flight time up by 24-hours, adding in a 12-hour overnight layover in Barcelona, of all places. So my flight time went from 3 hours to 21 hours, and on the wrong day.

Sticking with this new flight would require cancelling hotel reservations, missing my next connecting flight, and paying for hotels in countries that are not on my itinerary.

I understand that flight times change, but this change came so late in the game it's very expensive to find a new connecting flight. Vueling will refund the flight, but they cannot refund me for that tiny remaining part of my innocence that has now grown weary and jaded."|vueling-airlines
1385|"Booking a cheap flight caused me to lose valuable time & more money. They cancelled my flight that was scheduled at 11:50pm and no other plane was available until 7am the next morning. Worse part is that no one got a refund because ""the cancellation was out of their control"" and to top it off, we were not informed about the cancellation until 3am, 3 hrs after our scheduled departure. They first time they told us that our plane was 30 mins delayed, then they said the aircrew was in the plane but checking equipment. After more than three hours, they finally said to go to the vueling customer service desk to get more information and then was told our flight had been cancelled.  Cheap=lost time+ lost money! Price was not worth the stress and frustration experienced! Stay Away! Run! Dont walk!"|vueling-airlines
1386|Do yourself a favor and do NOT fly on an Airbus A320. There is simply not enough space in a seat for a normal sized man to exist. I mean to say, the flying conditions are inhumane.

1388|"Shocker

Sends me ticket with incorrect passenger name

I ring customer support and have to enter my reservation number three times as it's a voice recognition system and it mishears you and makes you go through each letter again and again

Then I press ""3"" for English. The customer service agent speaks very poor English and is tells me repeatedly that my ticket is correct and sends me out a faulty ticket, again. She eventually uses her eyes and sees that the ticket is incorrect. Doesn't apologise or admit her error.

Then I advise her the link that I am required to click in the email to enter ""advanced passenger information"" is not working and sends me to ""manage my booking"". She is so unfamiliar with her own company policies and process and her English is so poor that she has no idea what I am talking about. After repeating myself multiple times and slowing down, and her either asking me to repeat myself again or giving me incorrect information, I ask to speak to her supervisor. She acts all uppity and starts calling me ""ma'am"" and getting defensive ""I'm the supervisor of this call"". What's a ""supervisor of a call""? She claims she has no other supervisor. All her responses are inaccurate - she keeps telling me she doesn't understand or confidently telling me how to ""check my booking"" in garbled English or confidently directing me to the website - and then is unable to tell me where to go on the website. I ask her to look at the email she sent me to identify the link and she says ""I can see the email MAAM"", in a rude tone. I tell her to use her eyes (as she was equally insistent that my name was correct on the booking until she admitted it wasn't, once she looked correctly) and then turns out she was saying ""I CAN'T see the email"". So given her accent and the phone line, she should have said CAN NOT. How can a company not see the email that they are sending customers and a customer service agent not be familiar with its contents? From that point on, when she cannot understand me, rather than admitting her limitations, she simply calls me ""Ma'am"" in a sarcastic manner and confidently gives me the wrong answer or tells me to go to the website or confidently repeats some irrelevant comment about ""checking your booking"". It's the strategy of going on the offensive when you are feeling defensive.

When I ask if there is an office at the airport, she gets all offended and says ""no! no!"" in that same uppity tone. It's a total lie - they have a whole desk at the airport - but it's closed when I get there but I can go, tomorrow. She randomly tells me in an uppity defensive tone that if I want to talk to someone else I have to hang up and call back - and go through the voice recognition and be on hold for several minutes again. So it stops being about the customer and it's all about her ego, and me asking if there is somebody at the airport for me to speak to. She isn't the slightest bit concerned about me and my needs. She clearly self identities that she doesn't have the English language skills or company knowledge to know the responses to my question and is acting petulant instead of humble. When I advise her I am catching a bus to the airport soon and cannot call back, she just repeats it in an offhand dismissive way. I advise her again I cannot and she simply says she cannot (refuses to) help me and hangs up.

She could have put my call on hold and spoken to someone with better language skills and more competent at their knowledge of the company - but no, acting uppity and hanging up is her way.

I have another entitled millennial with me who thinks it is fine to treat customers that way and to be offhand, give false answers confidently, refuse to seek help, tell you to call back and go back in the queue, call you ""Ma'am"" and go on the offensive when you are unqualified for the job you are being paid for, or take a risk that you won't end up on a flight because you haven't obeyed their instructions and filled out the advanced passenger information. But it's not him that will miss his flight and be stranded in a foreign country ..."|vueling-airlines

I understand documents need to be checked, but on more than one occasion since I could not check in ahead of time I was nearly bumped (LGW to BCN), and once I actually was bumped (BCN to MUC) because the flight was oversold. If you're flying full flights at a peak time like MWC or Oktoberfest, get to the airport early.

I also really dislike having to board via bus transfer instead of jet bridge but this doesn't happen every time."|vueling-airlines

I am disgusted, frustrated, and so confused how the FAA allows this. I am tall (for a girl) but only average height for a man. How do any men fly this airline?! I can't imagine being 6'0"" or taller! This was an impossibly uncomfortable trip. I was gritting my teeth in misery the entire time. What a disaster. So awful."|vueling-airlines
1395|"This airline was the worst I have ever flown with. My husband and I were on the last leg of our honeymoon - flying from Rome to Nice. My husband is a quadriplegic in a power wheelchair and with that, according to human rights laws and airline policies worldwide  in most civilized countries, can travel with his equipment for free as it is what he needs to get around and live as a regular person.

We had 5 bags - 2 personal and 3 medical equipment. They tried to charge us for ALL our bags and were terrible and rude to us without even listening to what we had to say. The kept us standing there for almost an hour talking to their ""boss"" and yelling at us telling us. It's hard enough travelling with a quadriplegic we did NOT need the attitude and horrible service.

After many tears I went myself to sit down and looked online and had to show them their own website where it says handicap travellers can travel with 2 pieces of medical equipment free of charge. They then became silent and told me i only had to pay for one medical equipment bag instead of all of them (this was after they said their BOSS told them to charge us for all bags). I ended up paying $90 EUROS, but no other airline we have ever been on (and we travel a lot) made us pay for ANY of his medical equipment.

We had to beg to be in a seat close to the doors as my husband has to be carried in on an ""aisle"" chair as his wheelchair is too big. They know this, but still assigned our seats at 28 rows to the back of the plane. Once they told us we could sit closer to the doors by the flight attendants, and after they filled the plane, we realized that most of the plane was empty for the flying and all the ""business class"" front row seats with extra leg room were empty. You would have thought that they would have offered us these seats as it is SO hard for my husband to fit in a regular one but NO they didn't. It was so bad.

It's not just about the fact that we had to pay. It's how they treated BOTH of us. Is this customer service? Especially when you have to work so hard to travel around and enjoy yourself with a disability.

Terrible terrible terrible. I will never fly with them again and will tell Everyone I know about this."|vueling-airlines
1396|WORST airline ever. We have been looking forward to our trip to Croatia for months. Booked rooms and flights and everything was ready to go. Well Vueling just notified us that they pushed back our flight by EIGHT hours. Which means we will not make our connecting flight in Rome to fly home and have to change our entire itinerary. I am SO upset by this company. I have never heard of an airline making such significant changes to a flight. Do yourself a favor and don't fly with them.|vueling-airlines
1397|"Vueling is a horrible company, do not let yourself get convinced by their cheap prices; you will pay dearly. During our vacation thru Europe, we booked a flight from Barcelona to Florence. Not only the flight was delayed by almost 2 hrs, but they told us we were bumped from the flight. In total, 18 people couldn't make that flight. They sent us to Venice, and from Venice to Florence they put us on a bus for 4 hrs. When we arrived at the Florence airport, they told us the bags were not there.  It took 3 days to get our luggage. We had to drive an hour to Pizza just to get one of the bags, and then back at Florence airport the next day for another bag. We had to buy clothes, toiletries and other stuff we needed since we didn't have our bags. This whole fiasco ruined our vacations in Florence, we couldn't enjoy because we spent most of our time back and forth to different airports looking for our luggage. I try calling them and it is imposible, you have to pay per minute in order to get thru and still that didn't work. Then I sent an email and got a response, they said to send them prove of the bookings, which I did. Then they asked me for my bank information, routing, account, address all that, they said I would get a wire transfer for $250 each ticket. That was at the end of September, is now December 7, and I still have not received any refund.  I keep on sending emails and the last one I received about 4 weeks ago is that they had technical issues worth heir system. Since hen I have not heard from them. They don't even answer my emails anymore.

We spent money buying things again during our vacation just because they lost our baggage. We lost one day of vacation because they bumped us from our flight, and they don't even care to make a situation right by offering compensation for the headaches.

DO NOT USE THIS AIRLINE. After what we went they, I googled Vueling, just to find similar reviews from other people. I wish I puke have search before buying flight tickets with them."|vueling-airlines
1398|"The worst flight I've ever taken. The flight attendants looked put out if you actually wanted to buy something from their beverage service which charged you for even soda. The worst part though was the lack of leg space. I've never had such tight accommodations and I have always had very small planes flying from small airports. I am 5'4"" and my knees touched the seat in front of me. My boyfriend is 6'4"" and he literally couldn't fit in the seat. His seat was also broken and wouldn't stay upright if he leaned back, which ended up being fine because he couldn't sit back or else his legs would be in even worse shape. The space between the seat and the seat in front is literally the size of a small android phone. NEVER FLY WITH THIS AIRLINE unless you enjoy human torture devices."|vueling-airlines

France but were still stuck at the airport. They make us take the hottest bus in the world with all the PASSENGERS to another terminal by this time it's like 315 already passed 3 hrs. I've email them got a reference number saying to them my flight was over 3 hrs late. They told me it wasn't and there nothing they can do for me. I got video footage of us not even in the air and that was at 3:25. Well over 3 hrs  which they said they weren't  over 3 hrs time period. Don't use this airline. They don't even followed their guidelines for compensation very disappointed. Lost out on my shuttle had to pay additional 70 euros to get to my hotel because the lack of responsibility they don't hold accountability for."|vueling-airlines
1400|"I never heard of this airline until I was researching how to get from Barcelona to Paris.  I was booking only a week in advance and I was surprised to see a fare that was only 10 euro more than taking one of the bus services would cost (Ouibus, megabus, eurolines).  That is pretty good for only 7 days advanced booking. So I booked it.  The first problem was trying to pay by credit card on their website.  I entered it multiple times and it kept saying it wasn't registering, so finally I checked the box that said it was a 'corporate card' to see if it would go through and it did.  For a 'corporate' fare, they tack on an arbitrary 1 euro charge.  Upon further reading of the tiny print, everything except a credit card issued within Spain is considered 'corporate'.  It must just be one of those poor translation things because to me a 'corporate' card implies a commercial type account where my employer has given me the card or whatever.  ANYWAY...
They waited until the last possible moment to post the gate number for my flight.  Other flights were listed but mine kept flashing that the gate info would show up shortly.  Finally it appeared and now had to run the gauntlet to get to that section of the airport.

The seats are ridiculous.  I am not a tall person and I felt squashed.  Not only squashed, the water bottle dropped out of my coat pocket and I could not contort myself enough to pick it up off the floor because the seats were so tight.  I guess if it had been my phone or something I really needed I would have had to wait until the plane cleared and get a broom handle while lying in the aisle to get it out from under the seats.  I don't know how anyone over 5'6' is going to be comfortable at all.

Landing in Paris is where you are really aware of your no frills price.  You are unleashed in the middle of a tarmac in some remote airstrip.  You have to walk down the steps with your luggage and get a bus to the terminal. From that terminal (in this case Terminal 3) you will walk what feels like 3/4th's of a mile to get to any part of the terminal that gets you to a connecting gate.  If you are cutting it close on your connecting flights, think twice about booking this airline, especially to Paris because that airport has new nightmares in store for you once Vueling is done with you.

I had no real issues but it isn't an airline I would book again.  My flight was relatively short.  Anything longer would have been quite unpleasant."|vueling-airlines
1401|Great trip until I had to deal with this airline, 3rd airline of this trip and by far the worst I have ever felt with...not just this trip.|vueling-airlines

1403|The worst airlines I have ever experienced in my life. Today I used Vueling airlines to travel from Barcelona, Spain to Malaga, Spain and back. Let me begin this post by saying the lack of organization was worse than that of a free for all bin in a used clothing store. The lines were impossible to find, not separated, and there was not a single assistant around to allow the process to move easier. The employees are poorly trained to their expertise and rude. There is zero space for luggage under the seats, and every single flight will require passengers to check their bags due to lack of space. We waited at the baggage gate for 30 minutes to receive our bags. Also our flight was delayed an hour, and with all seriousness our flight nearly crashed. I have never been so disgusted and terrified by an airlines and I refuse to believe that Vueling even is an airline in the first place.|vueling-airlines
1404|"Sweet, curly blonde haired lady, who helped me with my baggage situation!  I should have asked for her name...it was a shift hour at 5am on Friday, May 23rd!

Complimentary baggage check in and I didn't have to carry on the additional, but she checked it in as well!  I was surprised about the exceptional service on that!  Thank you!

It was a quick and smooth process to check in and to print the boarding pass, which they didn't charge a hefty fee like Ryan Air!  They don't nickel and dime.  Also, the airfare was competitively lower than Ryan Air!  Nice!

You'll see me flying more with Vueling!"|vueling-airlines
1405|"My Vueling Flight from Brussels to Barcelona was quite uneventful.

The only excitement might be when the check in agent saying my friend's carry on was too heavy to be treated as a carry on with all the beer glasses we got. Our tickets included 1 free check in luggage anyway.

We arrived Barcelona on time with all our luggage in one piece. The ticket was under $100.

I will definitely fly Vueling again in the future!"|vueling-airlines
1406|"Took off from Florence late. About 30 minutes into the 2.5 hour flight, the plane was flying very low and turning at 60-90 degree angles back and forth. We were told to put seats up and tray tables away. We were not told where we were landing or why until I asked and a flight attendant finally said there was a problem with the door. It was quite terrifying.
We landed and the crew said nothing and gave no additional information. We sat on the ground in Pisa for 2 hours. Had to deboard the plain to refuel, then took off again to go to the final destination.
After all this received no compensation from the airline."|vueling-airlines
1407|Vueling Airlines will be one of the worst flights you have if you ever fly them.  Our flight was cancelled by Vueling.  It was never rescheduled.  We where bused over two hours to another airport after waiting for over two hours at San Sebastian.  Had to wait over four hours once to the airport we did not pay to fly out of.  All in what was supposed to be a 45 min flight from San Sebastian to Barcelona turned into over 10 hour ordeal.  Vueling rejected our claim for refund even though our flight was cancelled.  Their customer service team onsite where terrible.  They would not give us any food vouchers.  Which as I researched is illegal to not to gave any vouchers to passengers that the airline has stranded.  Many of us on the flight asked over and over again.  NOTHING.  No refund or credit, NO food, NO water and over 10 hour delay.  Pay extra and go with a real airline.|vueling-airlines
1408|"THIEVES THIEVES THIEVES!!!!! THEY WILL STEAL FROM YOU!!!!! They offered a free check in, and so we agreed, however, they stole a bottle of perfume and a wallet we had just bought. If I could review 0 stars, I would. You thieves! DO NOT RIDE WITH THEM. Their customer service is also terrible, they do not offer solutions, just a poorly given short answer of no help AT ALL. Their response is equivalent to ""too bad""."|vueling-airlines
1409|This is the worse airline I sow in my life. I did travel with different company  I niver see the stupid and bad customer service like that . Alwyes late and the people work are very fucking rude . I will prefer to walk that to flay with cheat . Pleas think twice before you spend your money with that cheat that will make your day and your vacation fuck up.|vueling-airlines
1410|You get what you pay for. Economic flight but you will experience the feeling  of traveling like a sardine. I felt like they were a little understaff at the counter ,too.|vueling-airlines
