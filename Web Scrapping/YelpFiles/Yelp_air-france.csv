"Very average in flight service, no difference from competition. On line service is abysmal: my flight was canceled due to COVID19 and 6 weeks after I requested a refund I am still waiting. The excuses I was served on the phone were: ""covid/delays/lots of work/etc..."". I had to do the same with British Airways for another ticket: I got my refund in 3 days! Guess where I'll go for my next ticket?!  Also when I asked for my refund on the French website (airfrance.fr) I received an email asking me to make this request from the US website where apparently I had bought my ticket: well.... BA again: I had bought my ticket in the US, the person I got on the phone was in the UK and I still got a refund IN 3 DAYS! Despite BA's 12,000 layoffs! Air France, are you paying attention??",air-france
"I have not flown Air France for years and saw the negative Yelp reviews of their Service.    I found business class to be superb ( and the price very reasonable for what you get).    Their lounges range from good to excellent.    The planes are not brand spanking new ( I believe they were Boeing 777). On the way over they had only biz and economy and on the way back they had first class which looked really nice. The seating for business class is excellent  1-2-1. We had the windows and it is very private and peaceful.    The business class seats are very comfortable and lie flat. Plenty of cushion and excellent width to sleep.    Entertainment is okay not fantastic but they have enough movies to entertain you ( not a lot of new releases but some).    Food was excellent. Great selection of entrees, wines, and constant nibbles. Nice breads and cheeses ( what do you expect from France?)    Everyone of the stewards was pleasant and helpful.    Luggage got to where it needed to be.    I would definitely fly them again",air-france
Ghetto. Absolutely trash. Do not book with air france it's a waste of time. All air france employees are trained to cause problems and problems only. Disgusting will never fly with this airline ever again. You better flying with Spirit Airlines.....,air-france
"The review is for incompetence of call center booking agents at Air France.  I was trying to buy a ticket for me and and extra seat for my oversized musical instrument (cello). I called probably five or six times and waited for 24 hours for the request t one approved. Every time my request was denied because the codeshare air company and Air France were not able to agree on the terms of how to PROPERLY submit the cabin baggage request through the system... WTH?!  Every time I would call again to check on the status of the request, an incompetent agent would erase the reservation and made a new one creating more confusion.  C'mon Air France, it cannot be that hard to book an extra seat for the cello!  I'm flying with the different company!",air-france
"It's been a while since I flew Air France long-haul last time, but I enjoyed the overall experience.  The check-in counter lady was polite and very friendly, and went though all the details including TSA pre-check eligibility, AF lounge, connection at CDG, etc.    The lounge @ SFO was okay, and nothing to write about...    The aircraft was B777-300 which had the updated Business Class seats with 1-2-1 setting (solo seats at window, 2 seats in the middle).  Selecting the small cabin with only 4 rows just behind the La Premiere section was perfect - more private than the second cabin.    The service was great - probably being served by 3-4 professional and friendly crew.  All was done in polished style.  Since they didn't have a printed menu (I was told they failed to load before leaving CDG), the crew explained four different options in detail along with his recommendations.  Glad to go with beef tenderloin (not over-cooked which is uncommon as airline food)...it was served with Edmond Fallot mustard selection which made me happy!    The breakfast was also served as individual pace - based on the timing when you wake up.  It was not like they wake you up when they decide to serve breakfast at most US carriers even on Business Class so that crew can cleanup way before landing and they can relax... ;)",air-france
"We upgraded two seats to business class and while boarding, we found a dirty fork on the seat. We almost sat on it. Plus, the seat and tray were dirty. This is truly unacceptable.    We were only offered an apology until I fought the issue for weeks. Then we were offered only one hundred. That's not fair at all.",air-france
"Second time this year flying with Air France and have been pleased both times. Flight attendants' demeanor is respectful and pleasant--they act as though it's their pleasure to serve you. Food is always good; alcoholic drinks are complementary (I always go with bubbly bc flying to Paris is always cause for celebration). Lastly-they are always on time, or early.",air-france
I have been trying to get a refund for over 3 months now.  Process is terrible. I received an email on 10 June saying they would process my refund. I put in the request on 6 May.  All other airlines and hotels have refunded me over a month ago.  Ridiculous and I will not bother with this airline in future.,air-france
"I am convinced that Air France ""customer care"" agents go out of their way to show customers that Air France does not believe in ""customer service"" and if they can screw you out of money, they will do it with pleasure.  In October 2019,  I flew to Paris from Marseille and my new baby stroller did not make it with the rest of my luggage.  I made a report and AF promised to deliver the stroller the next day.  2 days and many phone calls later, the AF agent told me that I could buy a new baby stroller for up to 100 euros since we had no way to tour Paris without a stroller for my 18 month old. I bought the cheapest stroller for 40 euros.  2 weeks later, back in Marseille, I received a dirty, torn up stroller.  When I filed a claim, the agent rejected it stating: ""We normally advise our customers to rent a stroller while it is delayed.""????  July 2020 I decided to give AF another chance.  We flew from Paris to Chicago on an almost empty flight.  We checked 6 pieces of luggage, 2 1/2 hours before departure...and still AF managed to lose my luggage!  I immediately filed a report and spoke to 3 agents on the phone regarding reimbursement.  They all said I was eligible for reimbursement, I simply needed to submit my receipts online.  Not one mentioned a deadline.  Despite many difficulties during our trip, including a sick child, I submitted my reimbursement claim 26 days after I received my luggage. I  immediately received a response from the ""customer care"" agent that the deadline was 21 days, so Air France would not give me any compensation for having to spend the the first 4 days of my vacation without my luggage. She didn't even pretend to care or try to fix my problem because she didn't care.",air-france
"I flew air france business class to CDG from SFO non stop using an airbus. Everything went smooth with the exception of the boarding area in SFO where passengers started to pack near the door entrance to the ramp when it was time to board and it almost seemed chaotic with no clear indication where you were supposed to go based on your seating/class. There was alot of ""excuse me,coming through"" to get through the crowded area. The business cabin itself was decent with almost pod like set up for your seat. I liked the lie flat seats and lovely food served during the flight. Although it was a bumpy ride with lightning seen over the horizon through my window, I was still able to catch some sleep before landing. The lavatory is the typical ones you would see in a plane, nothing fancy or bigger. I would definitely fly air france again.",air-france
"I was on Air France website and was in the process of booking fares for my wife and I to Paris...  I intentionally started with the airfare, because we have the flexibility to travel at anytime.  So I found a fare from SFO to CDG on the 6th of September, for $667.00 per person for premium economy.  Located a return fare on September 19th, for $587.00 per person for premium economy.  Awesome!!!    I was able to select my seats, for both flights 25G and 25H.  Good!!!  When I went to pay for the fares, their website came back with a &^*%$@ing Error!  I had to start over.  The only problem is they jacked up the departing fare to $1,557!!!   WTF!  Air France is a messed up company!  I really enjoyed them when we flew to Tahiti, but these kind of tactics are BS!  Don't Fly AIR FRANCE!    Update:  Called Air France this morning to speak to customer care.  Instead I ended up talking with a supervising agent.  I explained what happened yesterday and she was apologetic.  She asked if I still had the travel day flexibility I mentioned above.  With that, she was able to find me the prices I was looking for on slightly different days.  I tried doing that yesterday, but was not as successful as her.  She really worked the software over to find me seats at the prices I had found before.  Thank goodness for all of you who still care about customer service.    Jeff W",air-france
Flew business from SF to Paris. It was a small 777.    Service was very good...I was flattered that they initially spoke to me in French but sorry I don't remember any of the French I learned in middle school. The seat was older but comfy. It is not Emirates which is my favorite.,air-france
"Beware of flying 777-300's from Paris to SFO, these are older planes....bathrooms are smellier and facilities not as nice.    Also the seat back pockets let everything slip out (not enclosed), don't put your cell phone or anything important in there!    Food here does have a certain level of class that's ahead of most airlines.",air-france
"NEVER EVER FLY WITH THIS TERRIBLE AIRLINE!! The 3 times I have used them, my baggage was lost TWICE and the second time I didn't get my bags for THREE DAYS!!  They promised to call and email me and did absolutely nothing but get pissed off at me for being upset. Well try being in a foreign country and all your stuff missing except the clothes you have on for 3 days!  They are absolutely dumb and don't give a hoot about your concerns!    Never fly AIR FRANCE!!",air-france
Flight was ok. Not much to complain about but the food was pretty bad for airplane food.,air-france
The worst airlines ever. Systems are always down and they calculate fare change manually. I would really recommend Turkish airlines instead.,air-france
"Alan and I flew Air France Business Class yesterday from SFO to CDG in Paris.  Our experience was excellent from start to finish.  The woman who checked us in was very helpful, offering to call wheelchairs because the walk to security was long and the lines had been extremely long.  She did, but after waiting 15 or 20 minutes for the wheelchairs we decided to chance the walk.  As it happened, the walk wasn't that long, however, the lines were.  Alan did some scouting and found a very helpful man who directed us to TSA Pre Check, past the long lines.  Once in the Pre Check line we were erroneously directed to remove the laptop from Alan's carry-on, but a wonderful woman, Rosario T, took me under her wing and guided me through.  She deserves a separate review.  Just past security is the Air France/KLM Lounge, where we were welcomed.  The lounge is large, larger than we knew, w/ sandwiches, fruit and other food.  There's also an assortment of wines.  The woman at the front desk said the walk to the gate was a long one and ordered us two wheel chairs.  We were picked up a while before the plane started boarding and it was really helpful, as the walk would have been long and complicated w/ changes of levels, etc.    We boarded through one of three doors.  One of the flight attendants took my bag and helped me put it in the overhead bin.  The very best part was how mindful they were of Alan's need for a low sodium diet.  The meals were tasty and well prepared and he was very pleased.  My meals were quite good as well and my expectations for airline food are pretty low.  I had wanted scallops, but they were out, so I had beef and it was tender and cooked perfectly medium rare.  There were several courses and each one was good.  My only complaint would be that the champagne and the white wine weren't cold enough and the water for the tea wasn't hot enough.  Small complaints.  I skipped the morning meal because I'm never hungry in the morning.  We had wheelchairs ordered for CDG and so we had to wait aboard for them after we landed.  When they arrived the same flight attendant who helped me in helped me out.  There is a large flight crew and we were well attended.  Interestingly, none of the crew wore name tags, just patches reading ""Safety and Security"".  We've not seen that before.",air-france
"Air France, I want you to know that you have been absolutely fantastic. I will always seek out your airline and recommend it to everyone I know. I had to re-schedule my flight due to unexpected illness in my family and your representative here in the U.S Kristen/with Delta, was kind and understanding. So helpful and just human. She made this the best experience, better than anything I could imagine with any company. The help you have provided will allow me to take care of my family and turn an incredibly stressful day into worry free travel. Thank you Kristen and thank you Delta and most importantly, thank you AIR FRANCE. Merci beaucoup!    I am sorry I did  it get Kristen's last name, but if you can identify her, please tell her she has made a difference in two continents and all of our family thanks her from the bottom of our hearts.",air-france
"Air France delayed us by a day for our flight, but then offered nothing for doing so. We were given vouchers for a bottom tier hotel, and had to spend a good 8 or so hours dealing with incompetent employees who spoke incomprehensible English. Book at your own risk",air-france
"Delayed over an hour, staff speaks incomprehensible English, staff consistantly gave incorrect or false information about why people had to move seats.    Often, the pilot gave directions or information in French with no English accompaniment.    I would highly encourage all fliers to avoid Air France in the future",air-france
"After choosing our vacation flights, times comes to check in on line, where the misleading started. Offered for upgrades to business and we selected SFO to CDG 11 hours segment, and was successful transaction, however when we get to save boarding pass it show the upgrades was for different segment of our trip 5 hrs.    90 minutes on the phone to get to someone and in the end they fake us and let us to believe the problem was resolved and they upgraded the correct segment. At the airport there was nothing in the system and no one can help ""nothing we can do"" they said, we lost such $$$ for upgrades and got faked by customer service so we can put good survey answers on the feed back call.    My advise, never use their fake upgrades till you absolutely sure, even though you not protected.",air-france
"Very bad counter staff,  booked flight from sfo 7/1/12 with prepaid extra luggage for $60, however when we got to the counter    with one more bag they insist on charging $200 per luggage, I had to get he manager to read the company charge codes to believe me. The lady didn't apologize either",air-france
